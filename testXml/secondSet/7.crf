 Emergency Dept. Closed by Suspected Outbreak of Winter Vomiting Disease
 --------------------------------------------------
 .
 <COREF ID="1">An outbreak</COREF> of what is suspected to be <COREF ID="2">winter vomiting disease</COREF> forced the
 closure of Sunnybrook Hospital's emergency <COREF ID="3">department</COREF> on Monday morning.
 Over the weekend, a number of patients and staff were stricken by bouts of
 vomiting and diarrhea. By <COREF ID="4">Monday</COREF> afternoon <COREF ID="5">25 Nov 2002</COREF>, 28 <COREF ID="6">staff members</COREF> and
 13 <COREF ID="7">patients</COREF> showed symptoms of the virus infection, which is highly
 contagious and spread through person-to-person contact.
 "We haven't determined what <COREF ID="8">the infection</COREF> is yet. <COREF ID="9">We</COREF> suspect <COREF ID="10">it</COREF> to be a case
 of something called <COREF ID="11">winter vomiting disease</COREF>," <COREF ID="12">hospital</COREF> spokesman Craig
 DuHamel said. "Obviously <COREF ID="13">we</COREF> have to be very vigilant to ensure <COREF ID="14">this</COREF> is
 contained in <COREF ID="15">our</COREF> emergency <COREF ID="16">department</COREF>." The emergency <COREF ID="17">department</COREF> was
 expected to be closed until the afternoon of Wed <COREF ID="18">27 Nov 2002</COREF> at least,
 <COREF ID="19">DuHamel</COREF> said, adding that cleaning crews were on the <COREF ID="20">scene</COREF> with anti-viral
 agents [disinfectants?].
 Patients walking into <COREF ID="21">emergency</COREF> were told about <COREF ID="22">the situation</COREF> upon arrival
 and, if <COREF ID="23">their</COREF> condition was stable, asked to go to another hospital. Those
 who were unable to go to another <COREF ID="24">facility</COREF> would be treated, <COREF ID="25">the hospital</COREF>
 said in a news release. <COREF ID="26">Winter vomiting disease</COREF> is <COREF ID="27">an infection</COREF> caused by a
 virus commonly transmitted from person to person in cold weather, when
 people are indoors more often and in closer contact. <COREF ID="28">Symptoms</COREF> include severe
 nausea and <COREF ID="29">vomiting</COREF> that can last between 24 and 48 hours. <COREF ID="30">DuHamel</COREF> said <COREF ID="31">the
 virus</COREF> is not life-threatening and is similar to the Norwalk virus, which has
 made headlines recently for sickening hundreds of passengers on the
 Florida-based cruise ship
 Amsterdam.
 [As has been repeatedly stated in ProMED-mail, "<COREF ID="32">winter vomiting disease</COREF>" is
 a misnomer. Outbreaks in the UK and Ireland have occurred throughout the
 year in hospitals, health care facilities, and schools. In North America
 outbreaks on cruise ships have occurred during voyages to Alaska in the
 summer and to Caribbean destinations in the winter. Density and hygiene
 considerations are probably the relevant determining factors. <COREF ID="33">Winter
 vomiting disease</COREF> is caused by infection with a <COREF ID="34">Norwalk</COREF>-like <COREF ID="35">virus</COREF>, although
 <COREF ID="36">this</COREF> is seldom confirmed microbiologically. <COREF ID="37">Norwalk</COREF>-like <COREF ID="38">viruses</COREF> are a
 heterogenous <COREF ID="39">group</COREF> of caliciviruses that is now designated as the genus
 _<COREF ID="40">Norovirus</COREF>_. - Mod.CP]
