UNDATED: flight attendants.



<COREF ID="X25">Valujet</COREF>, which had proclaimed <COREF ID="5" REF="X25">itself</COREF> <COREF ID="6" REF="5">the fastest-growing airline
in history</COREF>, said last month that <COREF ID="7" REF="6">it</COREF> would buy fewer airplanes than
<COREF ID="8" REF="7">it</COREF> planned this year and would ``concentrate on <COREF ID="9" REF="8">its</COREF> product
integrity'' in anticipation of the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.


Last Jan. 12, a <COREF ID="10" REF="9">Valujet</COREF> DC-9 with 30 people aboard slid into a
snowbank after landing at <COREF ID="X3">Dulles International Airport</COREF> outside
Washington, closing <COREF ID="11" REF="X3">the airport</COREF> for three hours.


On Jan. 26, another a <COREF ID="12" REF="10">Valujet</COREF> DC-9 got stuck in the mud at
<COREF ID="X4">Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport</COREF> and 101 passengers had to
be bused back to <COREF ID="13" REF="X4">the terminal</COREF>.


On Feb. 28, another <COREF ID="14" REF="12">Valujet</COREF> plane ran off a runway in Savannah,
Ga. And on Mar. 19, <COREF ID="X5">an emergency chute</COREF> inflated inside the cabin of
a <COREF ID="X6">Valujet plane</COREF> in Tampa, Fla., slightly injuring a <COREF ID="X7">flight
attendant</COREF>; the pilot had to crawl out a window, climb into the <COREF ID="16" REF="X6">plane</COREF> through the tailcone and cut <COREF ID="17" REF="X5">the chute</COREF> with a knife to free <COREF ID="18" REF="X7">the attendant</COREF>. 


Because of the inaccessibility of Saturday's <COREF ID="19" REF="2">crash</COREF> site, few
details were available in the hours immediately after <COREF ID="90" REF="16">the plane</COREF>
went down. In <COREF ID="X9">its statement</COREF>, <COREF ID="21" REF="14">Valujet</COREF> said that <COREF ID="22" REF="90">Flight 592</COREF> had left <COREF ID="X10">Miami</COREF> at <COREF ID="X11">about 2:15 p.m.</COREF>, <COREF ID="23" REF="X11">more than 70 minutes</COREF> after its regularly
scheduled departure time.


<COREF ID="25" REF="21">It</COREF> said <COREF ID="26" REF="22">the DC-9-32</COREF>, <COREF ID="27" REF="26">a McDonnell-Douglas plane</COREF> configured with seats for 113 passengers, radioed at 2:25 p.m. that <COREF ID="28" REF="27">it</COREF> was
returning to <COREF ID="29" REF="X10">Miami</COREF>.


<COREF ID="30" REF="X9">The Valujet statement</COREF> did not mention <COREF ID="X12">smoke</COREF> in <COREF ID="X13">the cabin</COREF>, but
other reports said <COREF ID="X14">the pilot</COREF> had spoken to air-traffic controllers
of <COREF ID="32" REF="X12">smoke</COREF> in <COREF ID="33" REF="X13">the cabin</COREF>.


<COREF ID="34" REF="25">The airline</COREF> quoted preliminary reports as saying <COREF ID="35" REF="28">the plane</COREF> went
down about 20 miles northwest of <COREF ID="36" REF="29">Miami</COREF> ``in a dense area of the
Florida Everglades, making accessibility difficult.''


Three hours after <COREF ID="37" REF="19">the crash</COREF>, the <COREF ID="X15">FAA</COREF> reported that <COREF ID="38" REF="35">the jet</COREF> had
been about 100 miles northwest of <COREF ID="39" REF="36">Miami</COREF> when <COREF ID="40" REF="X14">the pilot</COREF> reported
<COREF ID="41" REF="32">smoke</COREF> in the cockpit, and that after turning around had gone about
80 miles before crashing.


The <COREF ID="42" REF="X15">FAA</COREF> report said <COREF ID="43" REF="38">the plane</COREF> had apparently gone into a steep
dive and exploded on impact.


<COREF ID="X16">A student pilot</COREF>, <COREF ID="44" REF="X16">Rick DeLisle</COREF>, who was flying a small plane in
the area with <COREF ID="X17">an instructor</COREF>, bound for Naples, Fla, told CNN of
witnessing <COREF ID="45" REF="37">the crash</COREF>. After hearing <COREF ID="46" REF="X17">his instructor</COREF> yelling, <COREF ID="48" REF="44">DeLisle</COREF>
said, ``<COREF ID="49" REF="48">I</COREF> turned and saw <COREF ID="X18">an explosion</COREF>.''


``There was nothing in the sense of fire,'' <COREF ID="50" REF="49">he</COREF> said. ``<COREF ID="51" REF="X18">It</COREF> was
almost like what <COREF ID="52" REF="50">I</COREF> would call <COREF ID="53" REF="51">a mushroom cloud</COREF>. <COREF ID="54" REF="53">It</COREF> went up 100
feet.''


<COREF ID="55" REF="52">DeLisle</COREF> said <COREF ID="X19">he and his instructor</COREF> flew closer and examined the
ground with <COREF ID="X20">binoculars</COREF>. ``<COREF ID="59" REF="X19">We</COREF> got down to about 200 feet or so, and
with <COREF ID="60" REF="X20">the binocs</COREF> <COREF ID="X21">it</COREF> looked like <COREF ID="61" REF="X21">a large trash bag worth of debris</COREF>.''


As word of <COREF ID="62" REF="45">the crash</COREF> was flashed over news reports, <COREF ID="X22">relatives of
people who had been on board</COREF> went to <COREF ID="X23">Miami International Airport</COREF>,
seeking information on what had happened.


<COREF ID="X24">Hernando Vergera</COREF>, <COREF ID="63" REF="X24">an airport spokesman</COREF>, said the Office of Dade
County Aviation was bringing counselors to meet with <COREF ID="65" REF="X22">family
members</COREF>, about 50 of whom were at the airport. <COREF ID="66" REF="65">They</COREF> were being
taken to an undisclosed location for privacy, <COREF ID="67" REF="63">Vergera</COREF> said.


<COREF ID="68" REF="34">Valujet</COREF> personnel at <COREF ID="69" REF="X23">the airport</COREF> declined to comment, and had
minimal contact with <COREF ID="70" REF="66">the families of the victims</COREF>, <COREF ID="71" REF="67">Vergera</COREF> said.
<COREF ID="72" REF="68">Valujet</COREF> did not immediately return telephone messages.


The Coast Guard told The Associated Press that rescue aircraft
were helping to look for wreckage and survivors. But all that
rescue pilots could detect was scorched earth, Petty Officer Angela
Weeks said.
