 Chagas <COREF ID="1" REF="X1">disease</COREF> is caused by the protozoan parasite _<COREF ID="X3">Trypanosoma cruzi</COREF>_. 
 Chagas <COREF ID="2" REF="X1">disease</COREF> following organ <COREF ID="3" REF="X2">transplantation</COREF> has occurred in Latin 
 America, where Chagas <COREF ID="4" REF="2">disease</COREF> is endemic, but <COREF ID="5" REF="4">it</COREF> has not yet been reported 
 in <COREF ID="X4">the United States</COREF>.
 A <COREF ID="X5">report</COREF> in the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
 &lt;<COREF ID="6" REF="X5">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm</COREF>&gt; describes three 
 <COREF ID="X6">cases</COREF> in the <COREF ID="7" REF="X4">United States</COREF> of _<COREF ID="8" REF="X3">T. cruzi</COREF>_ <COREF ID="X7">infection</COREF> associated with 
 <COREF ID="9" REF="X2">transplantation</COREF> of solid <COREF ID="X8">organs</COREF> from the same <COREF ID="X9">donor</COREF>. <COREF ID="X10">The Centers for 
 Disease Control and Prevention</COREF> will collaborate with <COREF ID="10" REF="X4">US</COREF> transplant 
 organizations to discuss whether to screen potential donors for _<COREF ID="11" REF="8">T. cruzi</COREF>_ 
 <COREF ID="12" REF="X7">infection</COREF> and, if so, which donors to screen, how to screen, and what to do 
 if the screening tests are positive.
 [<COREF ID="13" REF="12">Infection</COREF> with _<COREF ID="14" REF="11">T. cruzi</COREF>_ can be activated during immunosuppression in 
 organ <COREF ID="X11">recipients</COREF> and can be transferred with the organ to <COREF ID="15" REF="X11">the recipient</COREF>. 
 The first situation is well known in countries where _<COREF ID="16" REF="14">T. cruzi</COREF>_ is common, 
 especially after bone marrow transplantation. The second situation has been 
 described several times after renal transplants where the kidney came from 
 a _<COREF ID="17" REF="16">T. cruzi</COREF>_ infected donor. The three <COREF ID="18" REF="X6">cases</COREF> in the <COREF ID="19" REF="X4">US</COREF> all refer to <COREF ID="20" REF="X8">organs</COREF> 
 from the same <COREF ID="21" REF="X9">donor</COREF>, and the <COREF ID="22" REF="X5">comment</COREF> on the <COREF ID="23" REF="X10">CDC</COREF> website emphasises that 
 organ <COREF ID="24" REF="9">transplants</COREF> save life and that medical personnel should be aware that 
 Chagas <COREF ID="25" REF="X1">disease</COREF> is one of the possible risks associated with organ 
 <COREF ID="26" REF="X2">transplantation</COREF>. <COREF ID="X12">Mod.EP</COREF>]
