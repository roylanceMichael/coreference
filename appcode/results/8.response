<COREF ID='X32'>Striking auto workers</COREF> and Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit appeared to be making progress in <COREF ID='X28'>negotiations</COREF> yesterday, as <COREF ID='4' REF='X20'>the company</COREF> said <COREF ID='5' REF='4'>it</COREF> planned to make <COREF ID='6' REF='X4'>a new contract offer</COREF> by this morning.
Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., Ford Motor <COREF ID='X36'>Co.</COREF> and <COREF ID='X43'>the United Auto Workers union</COREF> continued <COREF ID='9' REF='X28'>negotiations</COREF> into the evening <COREF ID='10' REF='X36'>yesterday</COREF> , but neither side would officially discuss progress.
Early in <COREF ID='11' REF='X43'>the day</COREF> , bargaining committee members had reported to <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>their</COREF> <COREF ID='13' REF='X43'>union</COREF> locals that <COREF ID='X46'>a settlement</COREF> was imminent.
Still, <COREF ID='14' REF='9'>negotiations</COREF> dragged on.
Late last night <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>union</COREF> officials were still hoping to announce <COREF ID='16' REF='X46'>a settlement</COREF> by early this morning.
<COREF ID='X57'>UAW President Owen Bieber</COREF> was absent from <COREF ID='X55'>the talks</COREF> all day.
<COREF ID='18' REF='15'>The 57-year-old union leader</COREF> checked into Henry Ford Hospital in <COREF ID='X61'>Detroit Tuesday</COREF> night for testing because of abdominal pain, <COREF ID='X59'>one source</COREF> said.
The tests ruled out any heart problems, and <COREF ID='20' REF='X57'>Mr. Bieber</COREF> was apparently in "good condition," <COREF ID='21' REF='X59'>the source</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='22' REF='21'>He</COREF> added that <COREF ID='23' REF='20'>Mr. Bieber</COREF> 's hospitalization doesn't affect the pace of <COREF ID='24' REF='14'>negotiations</COREF> .
A <COREF ID='25' REF='X9'>UAW</COREF> spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report.
In Toronto, Robert White, <COREF ID='26' REF='15'>president of the Canadian Auto Workers union</COREF> , said <COREF ID='28' REF='26'>he</COREF> expects <COREF ID='29' REF='6'>the new offer</COREF> from <COREF ID='30' REF='X2'>Chrysler Canada Ltd.</COREF> to contain <COREF ID='X86'>sweetened cost-of-living adjustments</COREF> for pensioners.
<COREF ID='X92'>The Canadian union</COREF> has made <COREF ID='32' REF='X86'>inflation-indexed pension payments</COREF> <COREF ID='34' REF='32'>its</COREF> top priority in <COREF ID='35' REF='X55'>the talks</COREF> .
<COREF ID='36' REF='23'>Mr. White</COREF> said negotiators "unlocked the logjam on the main issue" after all-night meetings <COREF ID='37' REF='X61'>Tuesday</COREF> and <COREF ID='38' REF='10'>yesterday</COREF> .
<COREF ID='39' REF='X92'>The union</COREF> struck <COREF ID='40' REF='30'>Chrysler Canada</COREF> <COREF ID='41' REF='37'>Tuesday</COREF> after rejecting <COREF ID='42' REF='4'>a company</COREF> offer on pension adjustments.
<COREF ID='44' REF='39'>The union</COREF> said <COREF ID='X109'>the size</COREF> of <COREF ID='45' REF='X86'>the adjustments</COREF> was inadequate.
But Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, <COREF ID='47' REF='X109'>William Fisher</COREF> , said <COREF ID='48' REF='38'>yesterday</COREF> that <COREF ID='X115'>the two sides</COREF> had reached "some understandings" on economic issues, including pensions.
" <COREF ID='50' REF='X115'>We</COREF> have a good chance of wrapping <COREF ID='X127'>something</COREF> up by <COREF ID='51' REF='X127'>the end of the week</COREF> ," <COREF ID='52' REF='X127'>he</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='53' REF='36'>Mr. White</COREF> allowed negotiations on <COREF ID='X134'>local issues</COREF> to resume <COREF ID='54' REF='48'>yesterday</COREF> .
<COREF ID='55' REF='X134'>About 200 local issues</COREF> that remain unsettled had been suspended while the <COREF ID='56' REF='54'>CAW</COREF> and <COREF ID='57' REF='40'>Chrysler</COREF> grappled with <COREF ID='58' REF='X134'>the pension issue</COREF> .
If a settlement comes <COREF ID='60' REF='58'>today</COREF> or tomorrow, <COREF ID='61' REF='57'>Chrysler</COREF> 's 10,000 Canadian workers could vote on <COREF ID='62' REF='X4'>a contract</COREF> <COREF ID='63' REF='62'>this weekend</COREF> , when <COREF ID='64' REF='44'>the union</COREF> has scheduled membership meetings for <COREF ID='65' REF='X32'>the striking workers</COREF> .
<COREF ID='66' REF='61'>Chrysler</COREF> said <COREF ID='67' REF='34'>its</COREF> four Canadian plants could resume production <COREF ID='X148'>Monday</COREF> if <COREF ID='68' REF='29'>a new pact</COREF> is accepted.
A <COREF ID='69' REF='42'>company</COREF> spokesman said about 2,285 workers remain on layoff at <COREF ID='X155'>two U.S. plants</COREF> as a result of <COREF ID='70' REF='X3'>the Canadian strike</COREF> .
As previously reported, <COREF ID='71' REF='66'>Chrysler</COREF> stopped output of Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker cars <COREF ID='X163'>yesterday</COREF> at its Belvidere, Ill., plant because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts.
Some 1,700 of <COREF ID='73' REF='X155'>the plant</COREF> 's 2,900 hourly employees were laid off as a result.
Also, about 585 workers were laid off at <COREF ID='X182'>a stamping plant</COREF> near Detroit because the parts <COREF ID='75' REF='50'>they</COREF> make aren't needed in Canada during <COREF ID='76' REF='70'>the strike</COREF> .
<COREF ID='77' REF='X182'>That plant</COREF> normally employs 2,800 hourly workers.
The <COREF ID='78' REF='56'>CAW</COREF> 's contracts with <COREF ID='79' REF='71'>Chrysler</COREF> and the Canadian units of General Motors Corp. and <COREF ID='80' REF='X36'>Ford Motor Co.</COREF> expired Monday.
Talks with <COREF ID='81' REF='X11'>GM</COREF> and <COREF ID='82' REF='X7'>Ford</COREF> are on hold pending the outcome of <COREF ID='83' REF='35'>the Chrysler talks</COREF> .
In <COREF ID='85' REF='83'>the Ford-UAW talks</COREF> , the two parties turned to economics <COREF ID='88' REF='X163'>yesterday</COREF> in addition to the job-security issue.
Sources said <COREF ID='90' REF='82'>Ford</COREF> expressed willingness to offer some sort of base-wage raise, or annual improvement factor, but <COREF ID='X214'>it</COREF> wasn't clear how much or for how many years.
In the previous contract, <COREF ID='91' REF='69'>the company</COREF> made lump-sum payments instead of base-wage raises in two of the three years.
<COREF ID='92' REF='X214'>It</COREF> offered <COREF ID='X234'>no base-wage</COREF> raises in <COREF ID='93' REF='67'>its</COREF> initial proposal this year.
On <COREF ID='94' REF='55'>the job-security issue</COREF> , it is understood that <COREF ID='96' REF='90'>Ford</COREF> agreed not to lay off any workers during the life of <COREF ID='X241'>the contract</COREF> except during a major sales plunge.
<COREF ID='97' REF='91'>The company</COREF> also promised to replace half of all workers leaving <COREF ID='98' REF='91'>the company</COREF> .
At last report, <COREF ID='99' REF='X115'>the two sides</COREF> were still haggling over details of the job-security plan, while also discussing the wage and benefit package.
<COREF ID='101' REF='X241'>The contract</COREF> expired at midnight <COREF ID='102' REF='X148'>Monday</COREF> , but <COREF ID='103' REF='64'>the union</COREF> , citing progress, agreed to an indefinite extension.
The <COREF ID='104' REF='25'>UAW</COREF> 's contract with <COREF ID='105' REF='81'>GM</COREF> also expired <COREF ID='106' REF='102'>Monday</COREF> , but negotiations with <COREF ID='107' REF='X234'>the No. 1 auto maker</COREF> were postponed pending a settlement with <COREF ID='108' REF='96'>Ford</COREF> .
<COREF ID='109' REF='79'>Chrysler</COREF> 's <COREF ID='110' REF='X155'>U.S.</COREF> contract doesn't expire until next year.
<COREF ID='111' REF='88'>Yesterday</COREF> in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, <COREF ID='112' REF='109'>Chrysler</COREF> closed at $42.25, down $1.
<COREF ID='113' REF='108'>Ford</COREF> closed at $104, down 62.5 cents.</TXT>
