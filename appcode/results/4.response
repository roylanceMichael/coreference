As <COREF ID='X20'>senior director</COREF> of UAL, and <COREF ID='X16'>a member</COREF> of the executive committee of its board, <COREF ID='3' REF='X16'>I</COREF> am appalled at <COREF ID='X26'>the inaccuracies and anti-management bias</COREF> in the Journal's April 17 article about Richard Ferris, <COREF ID='6' REF='3'>UAL's chief executive officer</COREF> .
<COREF ID='8' REF='X6'>The UAL board</COREF> is four-square behind <COREF ID='10' REF='X26'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> , <COREF ID='11' REF='10'>his</COREF> management team and <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>his</COREF> long-range strategy of making <COREF ID='X33'>United</COREF> <COREF ID='X40'>a more competitive airline</COREF> by combining <COREF ID='14' REF='X33'>it</COREF> with <COREF ID='X39'>the premier hotel company</COREF> and car rental company.
Contrary to what <COREF ID='15' REF='X4'>the Journal article</COREF> suggests, board members have not been dissatisfied with <COREF ID='X48'>the financial performance</COREF> of <COREF ID='18' REF='X39'>Westin Hotels</COREF> and <COREF ID='19' REF='X48'>Hertz</COREF> .
Like <COREF ID='20' REF='10'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> , <COREF ID='21' REF='X20'>the directors</COREF> have been dissatisfied with <COREF ID='X51'>the earnings</COREF> of United Airlines.
<COREF ID='23' REF='12'>We</COREF> share <COREF ID='24' REF='23'>his</COREF> determination to improve <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>them</COREF> .
But <COREF ID='26' REF='25'>we</COREF> recognize that fare wars begun by non-union airline competitors have been responsible for a large part of <COREF ID='27' REF='26'>our</COREF> difficulties.
<COREF ID='28' REF='20'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> and Jim Hartigan, <COREF ID='29' REF='X33'>president of United</COREF> , are taking steps to improve <COREF ID='31' REF='X51'>its earnings</COREF> .
First-quarter financial results of <COREF ID='33' REF='X40'>the airline</COREF> should show a substantial improvement over comparable 1986 results, raising the prospect of a much better year-over-year financial performance in 1987.
Contrary to the implication in <COREF ID='34' REF='15'>your article</COREF> , the fact that the outside directors have employed <COREF ID='X96'>independent legal and financial counsel</COREF> in response to the pilots' proposal to purchase <COREF ID='36' REF='29'>United</COREF> does not bespeak a lack of confidence in <COREF ID='37' REF='28'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> .
The employment of <COREF ID='38' REF='X96'>independent counsel</COREF> by <COREF ID='X100'>outside directors</COREF> is standard procedure in proposed corporate buyout situations.
The Journal's reference to Donald Trump's reputed desire to cause the breakup of <COREF ID='40' REF='X6'>UAL</COREF> so that <COREF ID='41' REF='40'>he</COREF> can own <COREF ID='X115'>the Century Plaza</COREF> Hotel in Los Angeles ignores an important fact: <COREF ID='42' REF='X6'>UAL</COREF> does not own <COREF ID='43' REF='X115'>the Century Plaza</COREF> .
Most unfair and inaccurate was <COREF ID='44' REF='X4'>the Journal</COREF> 's reference to <COREF ID='X124'>the case</COREF> of the "570 newly hired pilots" whom <COREF ID='X123'>United</COREF> "tried to fire" because <COREF ID='X122'>they</COREF> "refused to cross picket lines."
<COREF ID='48' REF='X124'>These</COREF> are <COREF ID='49' REF='X122'>pilots</COREF> who in 1985 were offered and accepted pre-hiring training with the knowledge <COREF ID='X133'>they</COREF> would be expected to fly if United's service were to be disrupted by <COREF ID='X136'>a strike</COREF> later that year.
When the pilots' strike occurred, <COREF ID='56' REF='X133'>the trainees</COREF> declined to cross the picket line; thus, <COREF ID='58' REF='X123'>United</COREF> declined to hire <COREF ID='59' REF='X133'>them</COREF> .
In litigation that arose out of <COREF ID='60' REF='X136'>the strike</COREF> , <COREF ID='X156'>a federal district court</COREF> ruled that <COREF ID='61' REF='59'>the 570 individuals</COREF> must be hired by <COREF ID='62' REF='58'>United</COREF> , and <COREF ID='63' REF='59'>they</COREF> have been flying in <COREF ID='64' REF='58'>United</COREF> cockpits ever since.
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a circuit court reversal of <COREF ID='65' REF='X156'>the district court</COREF> , and held that <COREF ID='66' REF='62'>United</COREF> was not required to hire <COREF ID='67' REF='49'>the 570 pilots</COREF> .
However, in an effort to let bygones be bygones, <COREF ID='68' REF='66'>United</COREF> management declined to take advantage of <COREF ID='69' REF='31'>its</COREF> court victory, and <COREF ID='70' REF='14'>it</COREF> retained <COREF ID='71' REF='67'>the 570 pilots</COREF> with seniority dating from 1985 when <COREF ID='73' REF='63'>they</COREF> actually began flying for <COREF ID='74' REF='66'>United</COREF> .
Neither <COREF ID='75' REF='37'>Mr. Ferris</COREF> nor <COREF ID='76' REF='X100'>the board of directors</COREF> has any desire to "break" the pilots' union.
If harsh things were said by either side in the heat of <COREF ID='78' REF='60'>the 1985 pilot strike</COREF> , or since, <COREF ID='X184'>we</COREF> regret <COREF ID='81' REF='X184'>them</COREF> , and want to forget <COREF ID='82' REF='81'>them</COREF> .
<COREF ID='83' REF='X184'>We</COREF> like and admire <COREF ID='84' REF='71'>our pilots</COREF> , who are <COREF ID='X195'>the best</COREF> in the business, and <COREF ID='85' REF='83'>we</COREF> respect <COREF ID='86' REF='X195'>their</COREF> right to have a strong union.
<COREF ID='87' REF='85'>We</COREF> are sure that, likewise, <COREF ID='88' REF='87'>they</COREF> want <COREF ID='89' REF='88'>us</COREF> to do <COREF ID='90' REF='89'>our</COREF> best to keep <COREF ID='91' REF='68'>United</COREF> a strong and prosperous employer. <COREF ID='92' REF='X195'>Charled F. Luce</COREF>
