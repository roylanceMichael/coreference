ROCHESTER, Mich.
<COREF ID='2' REF='X2'>Chrysler Corp.</COREF> this year will take <COREF ID='X15'>the highly unusual step</COREF> of setting up <COREF ID='3' REF='X4'>a formal grievance procedure</COREF> for its non-union white-collar employees.
" <COREF ID='6' REF='X15'>We</COREF> understand <COREF ID='X21'>that</COREF> ( <COREF ID='7' REF='X2'>Chrysler</COREF> 's) <COREF ID='X31'>dramatic restructuring</COREF> . . . will inevitably lead <COREF ID='X24'>many employees</COREF> to question management's decisions and actions," Anthony P. St. John, <COREF ID='8' REF='6'>vice president for human resources</COREF> of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at Oakland University <COREF ID='10' REF='X21'>here</COREF> yesterday.
"Employees may not feel that <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>they</COREF> are being treated fairly."
To "strengthen <COREF ID='12' REF='X31'>management</COREF> 's credibility," <COREF ID='13' REF='12'>Mr. St. John</COREF> added, <COREF ID='14' REF='13'>the company</COREF> will set up <COREF ID='15' REF='14'>an "alternative disputes resolution" system</COREF> similar to a traditional union grievance procedure.
"For the first time <COREF ID='16' REF='X24'>these employees</COREF> will be guaranteed <COREF ID='17' REF='3'>a formal and impartial internal mechanism</COREF> to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes," <COREF ID='18' REF='13'>Mr. St. John</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='19' REF='X4'>The process</COREF> will have several steps, concluding with <COREF ID='X60'>final arbitration</COREF> handled by a neutral third party.
Chrysler's move apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by <COREF ID='21' REF='11'>its</COREF> current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies.
<COREF ID='22' REF='X9'>The auto maker</COREF> is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash <COREF ID='23' REF='21'>its</COREF> white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of <COREF ID='24' REF='21'>its</COREF> acquisition last year of American Motors Corp.
<COREF ID='25' REF='7'>Chrysler</COREF> has <COREF ID='26' REF='16'>about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S.</COREF> , up sharply from <COREF ID='X85'>roughly 21,000</COREF> in 1982.
About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the United Auto Workers union.
Some analysts speculated <COREF ID='27' REF='X85'>the move</COREF> is designed to stave off further union organizing in <COREF ID='28' REF='11'>the white-collar ranks</COREF> .
Several management consultants said <COREF ID='29' REF='X60'>a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration</COREF> was common for government employees, but <COREF ID='30' REF='11'>they</COREF> had never heard of such <COREF ID='31' REF='29'>a policy</COREF> for <COREF ID='X97'>non-union employees</COREF> at a major private company.
" <COREF ID='32' REF='31'>It</COREF> has the potential of undermining supervisory and management responsibility and authority," said Jerrold Bratkovich, <COREF ID='33' REF='8'>a vice president</COREF> in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a management consulting firm.
"That's one of the main reasons employers don't want to have unionization."
<COREF ID='X131'>A Chrysler spokesman</COREF> said <COREF ID='37' REF='14'>the company</COREF> had studied "a couple" of other companies that had <COREF ID='38' REF='X97'>arbitration for nonunion employees</COREF> , but <COREF ID='39' REF='37'>he</COREF> couldn't recall which companies.
<COREF ID='X144'>A more common business approach</COREF> is the "open-door" policy such as that at International Business Machines Corp., where "any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction . . . can bring the complaint to the attention of higher management," said an IBM spokesman.
"If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the <COREF ID='41' REF='X144'>IBM</COREF> chief executive officer," <COREF ID='42' REF='X131'>the spokesman</COREF> added.
<COREF ID='43' REF='25'>Chrysler</COREF> will implement <COREF ID='44' REF='15'>its system</COREF> later this year.
The details haven't yet been worked out, <COREF ID='46' REF='43'>Chrysler</COREF> said.
According to <COREF ID='X161'>a slide</COREF> used in <COREF ID='47' REF='18'>Mr. St. John</COREF> 's presentation, <COREF ID='48' REF='31'>the policy</COREF> would cover all "professional, administrative, management and executive employees."
<COREF ID='49' REF='32'>It</COREF> would also have <COREF ID='50' REF='19'>a four-step grievance process</COREF> , just as <COREF ID='51' REF='X161'>UAW</COREF> -represented workers have.</TXT>
