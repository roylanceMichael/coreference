<COREF ID='1' REF='X7'>Sony</COREF> is thinking small in a big way about video.
A decade after <COREF ID='2' REF='X11'>its</COREF> Betamax home-video format lost out to rival VHS, <COREF ID='3' REF='1'>Sony Corp. of America</COREF> , <COREF ID='4' REF='3'>a unit of the Japanese consumer-electronics giant</COREF> , is trying to force <COREF ID='5' REF='2'>its</COREF> way back into <COREF ID='X38'>the video limelight</COREF> with its 8mm format, launched <COREF ID='X36'>four years</COREF> ago.
<COREF ID='8' REF='1'>Sony</COREF> hopes to popularize <COREF ID='9' REF='X38'>"Video 8"</COREF> through the concept of "personal video" -- <COREF ID='10' REF='X38'>video wherever you go</COREF> -- as exemplified by its Video Walkman line: <COREF ID='12' REF='X36'>tiny battery-operated color mini-TVs</COREF> with built-in videocassette recorders.
<COREF ID='13' REF='8'>Sony Corp.</COREF> has heavily promoted <COREF ID='14' REF='X38'>the Video Walkman</COREF> since <COREF ID='15' REF='X11'>the product</COREF> 's introduction last summer, but Bob Gerson, <COREF ID='16' REF='X38'>video editor</COREF> of This Week in Consumer Electronics, says <COREF ID='18' REF='8'>Sony</COREF> conceives of <COREF ID='19' REF='18'>8mm</COREF> as <COREF ID='20' REF='X11'>a "family of products, camcorders and VCR decks," whose sales will reinforce one another</COREF> .
<COREF ID='21' REF='20'>He</COREF> dismisses <COREF ID='22' REF='14'>the Video Walkman</COREF> as <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>an attention-getting gimmick</COREF> aimed mainly at well-heeled trend setters: "At $1,000 a pop, you don't sell <COREF ID='X83'>many</COREF> of <COREF ID='24' REF='12'>these things</COREF> ."
However, <COREF ID='25' REF='X83'>he</COREF> adds, "It's no secret that <COREF ID='26' REF='18'>Sony</COREF> is looking at <COREF ID='27' REF='19'>8mm</COREF> as <COREF ID='28' REF='27'>an all-purpose format</COREF> ."
More important to the future of <COREF ID='29' REF='27'>8mm</COREF> is <COREF ID='30' REF='26'>Sony</COREF> 's success in the $2.3 billion camcorder market.
<COREF ID='31' REF='X16'>The Japanese company</COREF> already has 12% of <COREF ID='32' REF='X8'>the total camcorder market</COREF> , ranking <COREF ID='33' REF='32'>it</COREF> third behind the RCA and Panasonic brands.
But 8mm video faces problems and tough competition.
For instance, <COREF ID='35' REF='28'>the rival VHS format</COREF> has "really got <COREF ID='36' REF='2'>its</COREF> hooks into the American consumer," says Thomas Chesser, <COREF ID='37' REF='4'>an electronics analyst</COREF> at Smith Barney.
And, <COREF ID='38' REF='29'>8mm cassettes</COREF> can't be played on existing VHS equipment.
In addition, there's a relative lack of film titles available in <COREF ID='40' REF='29'>8mm</COREF> .
The great advantage of <COREF ID='41' REF='40'>8mm</COREF> is size.
Over the past four years, 8mm video camcorders have been a big success among home-video buffs and techno-junkies, who have bought more than one million of <COREF ID='43' REF='4'>the compact units</COREF> that record and <COREF ID='X140'>play videos</COREF> on <COREF ID='X137'>tapes</COREF> the size of audiocassettes.
<COREF ID='X156'>That</COREF> compares with roughly paperback-book dimensions for <COREF ID='44' REF='35'>VHS</COREF> .
Accordingly, most <COREF ID='45' REF='44'>VHS</COREF> camcorders are usually bulky and weigh around eight pounds or more.
In contrast, <COREF ID='46' REF='30'>Sony</COREF> this month will introduce <COREF ID='47' REF='41'>a full-featured, $1,500 palm-sized 8mm model, the CCD-TR5 Handycam</COREF> , tipping the scales at less than two pounds.
But <COREF ID='50' REF='41'>8mm</COREF> is not automatically the walk-away winner in the compact-camcorder sweepstakes.
To compete with <COREF ID='51' REF='9'>Video 8</COREF> , Matsushita Electric Co.'s 51%-owned <COREF ID='X176'>JVC unit</COREF> introduced in 1986 a compact version of its dominant VHS format, called <COREF ID='53' REF='45'>VHS-C</COREF> , that is nearly as small as an <COREF ID='54' REF='50'>8mm videocassette</COREF> .
And <COREF ID='56' REF='53'>VHS-C</COREF> can be played on existing VHS machines with only a simple adapter; by contrast, <COREF ID='59' REF='X137'>8mm tapes</COREF> are incompatible with <COREF ID='61' REF='45'>the VHS machines</COREF> .
At present, <COREF ID='X190'>VHS-C machines</COREF> can record for only 20 or 30 minutes, while <COREF ID='65' REF='59'>8mm tapes</COREF> run as long as two hours.
<COREF ID='67' REF='X176'>JVC</COREF> says <COREF ID='68' REF='33'>it</COREF> is developing <COREF ID='X200'>a 40-minute <COREF ID='69' REF='56'>VHS-C</COREF> cassette</COREF> and that an enhanced Super VHS version of VHC-C (or <COREF ID='71' REF='69'>S-VHS-C</COREF> ) due this fall would be long enough to show a feature film in the extended-play mode with little detectable picture deterioration.
This summer, <COREF ID='72' REF='67'>JVC</COREF> launched an ad campaign emphasizing the <COREF ID='73' REF='69'>VHS-C</COREF> 's compatibility advantage over <COREF ID='74' REF='50'>8mm</COREF> , while its sister company, Panasonic, recently cut list prices $100 to $200 on some of <COREF ID='78' REF='36'>its VHS-C models</COREF> , to as low as $799.
List prices on <COREF ID='81' REF='46'>Sony</COREF> 's camcorders begin at $1,300.
Another problem for <COREF ID='82' REF='81'>Sony</COREF> is that while <COREF ID='X234'>nearly every movie title</COREF> is available on <COREF ID='83' REF='45'>VHS</COREF> cassettes, there are currently only about 1,400 titles on <COREF ID='84' REF='X140'>8mm video</COREF> .
Of <COREF ID='86' REF='X234'>those</COREF> , roughly 250 are feature films; the rest are video magazines, instructional films and documentaries.
At present, <COREF ID='87' REF='82'>Sony</COREF> <COREF ID='88' REF='87'>itself</COREF> is <COREF ID='X246'>the primary distributor</COREF> of <COREF ID='89' REF='65'>prerecorded 8mm tapes</COREF> through <COREF ID='91' REF='36'>its</COREF> mail-order Cinema 8 movie club.
Bill Fisher, <COREF ID='92' REF='X246'>national software-marketing manager</COREF> with Sony Video Products Co., says the company is adding three titles a month through licensing agreements with the home-video units of Paramount Communications Inc., Nelson Entertainment Co. and <COREF ID='X258'>Warner Communications Inc.</COREF>
For <COREF ID='95' REF='91'>its</COREF> part, <COREF ID='96' REF='X258'>the unit of what will soon be Time Warner Inc.</COREF> , entered <COREF ID='X269'>the market</COREF> last fall with 33 older catalog titles, and this year will release 20 new <COREF ID='97' REF='74'>8mm</COREF> titles.
And other companies, such as MGM/UA Communications Co. and RCA/Columbia have agreed to license some older titles to <COREF ID='98' REF='87'>Sony</COREF> .
Some studios remain hesitant to enter <COREF ID='99' REF='X269'>the market</COREF> because there isn't a critical mass of <COREF ID='100' REF='X190'>8mm machines</COREF> in consumers' homes.
"It's the proverbial chicken and egg situation," says George Krieger, <COREF ID='X299'>president and chief executive officer</COREF> of CBS/Fox Home Video, <COREF ID='103' REF='X246'>a leading videocassette distributor</COREF> that is a joint venture of CBS Inc. and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox studio, which isn't supplying any 8mm tapes at present.
Likewise, MCA Inc.'s home-video unit, which distributes <COREF ID='X308'>movies</COREF> made by Universal Studios, says <COREF ID='109' REF='68'>it</COREF> 's looking at <COREF ID='110' REF='X308'>the business</COREF> but isn't in <COREF ID='111' REF='109'>it</COREF> yet.
And <COREF ID='X316'>video retailers</COREF> are entering <COREF ID='112' REF='99'>the market</COREF> warily.
Tower Records, <COREF ID='113' REF='X316'>a 50-store audio and video retail chain</COREF> based in Sacramento, Calif., has been "testing" <COREF ID='114' REF='97'>8mm</COREF> software sales since April in 12 of <COREF ID='115' REF='95'>its</COREF> leading stores.
John Thrasher, <COREF ID='116' REF='X316'>Tower's top video buyer</COREF> , says <COREF ID='118' REF='116'>he</COREF> is "really pleased" with most of the test locations, but hastens to add: " <COREF ID='119' REF='118'>I</COREF> don't know how big of <COREF ID='X336'>an investment</COREF> that <COREF ID='120' REF='115'>we</COREF> as <COREF ID='121' REF='X316'>a retailer</COREF> can invest in <COREF ID='122' REF='35'>another video format</COREF> ."
In any case, <COREF ID='123' REF='X336'>he</COREF> says <COREF ID='124' REF='123'>he</COREF> intends to keep at least "a representation of some really hot titles" in <COREF ID='125' REF='114'>8mm</COREF> .
Minneapolis-based Musicland Group announced last Friday that <COREF ID='126' REF='111'>it</COREF> will begin test marketing of <COREF ID='127' REF='X200'>prerecorded 8mm cassettes</COREF> at 19 of <COREF ID='129' REF='115'>its</COREF> 745 audio and video outlets this month.
RKO-Warner Video Inc., <COREF ID='130' REF='113'>a 31-store New York-area chain</COREF> , is also dipping <COREF ID='131' REF='129'>its</COREF> toe into the <COREF ID='132' REF='125'>8mm</COREF> pool this month.
" <COREF ID='133' REF='120'>We</COREF> want to be <COREF ID='X373'>there</COREF> if there is <COREF ID='134' REF='110'>a business</COREF> in <COREF ID='135' REF='132'>8mm</COREF> ," says Jeff Levy, <COREF ID='136' REF='X299'>RKO-Warner vice president</COREF> , for purchasing.
Despite the heat of competition, <COREF ID='138' REF='X373'>Mr. Gerson</COREF> of This Week in Consumer Electronics thinks <COREF ID='140' REF='98'>Sony</COREF> can succeed in the <COREF ID='141' REF='112'>home-video market</COREF> in the same way <COREF ID='142' REF='126'>it</COREF> has thrived in the highly competitive color-television-set market.
" <COREF ID='143' REF='140'>Sony</COREF> only has 8% of <COREF ID='144' REF='141'>the market</COREF> ," <COREF ID='145' REF='144'>he</COREF> explains, "but <COREF ID='146' REF='133'>they</COREF> have 20% of the {high-end} market they want, and <COREF ID='148' REF='X156'>that</COREF> 's not bad."</TXT>
