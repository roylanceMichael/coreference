ST. PAUL, Minn.
<COREF ID='4' REF='X5'>The Northwest Airlines flight attendants union</COREF> said new wage and work rules <COREF ID='7' REF='X4'>the NWA Inc. unit</COREF> has proposed are "unacceptable," and renewed a strike threat.
Seeking to end a yearlong stalemate with <COREF ID='9' REF='4'>the union</COREF> , as previously reported, <COREF ID='10' REF='4'>Northwest</COREF> said Wednesday it plans unilaterally to impose new contract terms on <COREF ID='11' REF='4'>the attendants</COREF> April 1.
<COREF ID='12' REF='9'>Union</COREF> leaders complained <COREF ID='13' REF='10'>Northwest</COREF> is trying to "force a <COREF ID='14' REF='13'>strike</COREF> " and issued a statement advising passengers with reservations on <COREF ID='15' REF='10'>Northwest</COREF> over <COREF ID='X31'>the Easter holidays</COREF> to "make other arrangements."
<COREF ID='16' REF='12'>The union</COREF> , <COREF ID='17' REF='16'>a Teamsters chapter</COREF> , invited <COREF ID='X36'>leaders</COREF> of the unions representing Northwest pilots and machinists to <COREF ID='X40'>a strategy meeting</COREF> Monday in Washington.
The Teamsters have yet to win guarantees that <COREF ID='X48'>the other unions</COREF> would participate in a <COREF ID='24' REF='X40'>walkout</COREF> .
An Air Line Pilots Association spokesman said <COREF ID='25' REF='X36'>union leaders</COREF> haven't decided whether to attend <COREF ID='26' REF='X40'>the meeting</COREF> .
A spokesman for the machinists, <COREF ID='28' REF='X48'>Northwest's largest union</COREF> , couldn't be reached for comment.
A Northwest spokesman said management is "disappointed" by <COREF ID='31' REF='28'>the union</COREF> 's threat to disrupt <COREF ID='32' REF='X31'>holiday</COREF> service.
" <COREF ID='33' REF='25'>We</COREF> had hoped that if <COREF ID='34' REF='33'>they</COREF> didn't like the imposed (contract) policy, <COREF ID='35' REF='34'>they</COREF> would come back to bargaining table and get <COREF ID='X69'>something</COREF> better for <COREF ID='36' REF='35'>themselves</COREF> ," <COREF ID='37' REF='X69'>he</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='38' REF='31'>The attendants union</COREF> also called on <COREF ID='40' REF='38'>the company</COREF> 's board to replace Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier with "competent management."</TXT>
