Your Money Matters: <COREF ID='X4'>Massachusetts</COREF> Says <COREF ID='X2'>Brokers</COREF> Can't Insist on Arbitration
Christi Harlan (WSJ Staff)
SCR
<COREF ID='1' REF='X4'>Massachusetts</COREF> , in a move that may be repeated in a number of states, will eliminate <COREF ID='X16'>mandatory arbitration</COREF> in disputes between <COREF ID='2' REF='X2'>brokers</COREF> and investors.
A new regulation, scheduled to take <COREF ID='X22'>effect</COREF> Jan. 1, will require <COREF ID='3' REF='2'>brokers</COREF> to advise <COREF ID='4' REF='3'>customers</COREF> of <COREF ID='5' REF='X22'>their</COREF> constitutional right to take disputes to court.
And <COREF ID='6' REF='3'>brokers</COREF> can't refuse to do business with an <COREF ID='7' REF='X22'>investor</COREF> who declines to sign a statement agreeing to settle disputes through arbitration.
<COREF ID='X43'>The securities industry</COREF> has favored <COREF ID='9' REF='X16'>arbitration</COREF> because <COREF ID='10' REF='9'>it</COREF> keeps <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>brokers</COREF> and dealers out of <COREF ID='12' REF='X43'>court</COREF> .
But <COREF ID='X46'>consumer advocates</COREF> say <COREF ID='13' REF='4'>customers</COREF> sometimes unwittingly sign away <COREF ID='14' REF='X43'>their</COREF> right to sue.
" <COREF ID='15' REF='X46'>We</COREF> don't necessarily have <COREF ID='X49'>a beef</COREF> with <COREF ID='16' REF='9'>the arbitration process</COREF> ," says Martin Meehan, <COREF ID='17' REF='X49'>deputy secretary</COREF> of state in Massachusetts.
" <COREF ID='19' REF='15'>We</COREF> just think the <COREF ID='20' REF='X46'>consumers</COREF> ought to have a choice."
<COREF ID='21' REF='1'>Massachusetts</COREF> is the first of what may be several states to bar <COREF ID='22' REF='9'>mandatory arbitration</COREF> .
According to a survey by the North American Securities Administrators Association, which comprises <COREF ID='X71'>securities regulators</COREF> in the 50 states, a dozen or more states in the next six months expect to consider rules banning <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>forced arbitration</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X81'>The securities administrators</COREF> have a laundry list of complaints against <COREF ID='24' REF='23'>mandatory arbitration</COREF> .
"The panels (of arbitrators) are stacked in <COREF ID='X84'>favor</COREF> of <COREF ID='25' REF='X43'>the industry</COREF> , the proceedings are not public and there are no written decisions," says Scott Stapf, <COREF ID='26' REF='X84'>director</COREF> of consumer education for the administrators' association.
<COREF ID='29' REF='24'>Mandatory arbitration agreements</COREF> have proliferated since <COREF ID='X104'>the U.S. Supreme Court</COREF> ruled in <COREF ID='X102'>June 1987</COREF> that <COREF ID='31' REF='11'>brokers</COREF> could require that <COREF ID='32' REF='13'>their customers</COREF> sign <COREF ID='34' REF='19'>them</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X111'>The most common agreements</COREF> require <COREF ID='35' REF='32'>customers</COREF> who believe <COREF ID='36' REF='31'>their brokers</COREF> have defrauded <COREF ID='38' REF='34'>them</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID='39' REF='24'>arbitration</COREF> instead of filing a lawsuit.
Because of rules requiring abbreviated evidence and arguments, <COREF ID='40' REF='39'>arbitration</COREF> is generally faster than going to <COREF ID='41' REF='X104'>court</COREF> .
And the losing side has no route for appeal -- the arbitrator's decision is final.
The popularity of the <COREF ID='42' REF='X111'>agreements</COREF> among <COREF ID='43' REF='36'>brokers</COREF> was cemented after the October market crash.
As a result of previously signed agreements, hundreds of <COREF ID='44' REF='7'>investors</COREF> were forced to file arbitration claims, and <COREF ID='45' REF='43'>brokers</COREF> avoided time-consuming and expensive lawsuits.
But <COREF ID='46' REF='X81'>the securities administrators' association</COREF> said most of the 15,000 calls to its post-crash hotline were complaints about <COREF ID='48' REF='40'>forced arbitration</COREF> .
<COREF ID='49' REF='42'>Mandatory arbitration agreements</COREF> are most commonly required of <COREF ID='51' REF='35'>customers</COREF> buying on margin or dealing in options.
But <COREF ID='52' REF='X71'>the state securities regulators</COREF> want to make sure that the practice doesn't spread to the smaller, less risky cash <COREF ID='53' REF='51'>customers</COREF> , hence <COREF ID='54' REF='21'>the Massachusetts regulation</COREF> .
The Securities Industry Association, whose representatives testified against <COREF ID='56' REF='54'>the Massachusetts regulation</COREF> during public hearings in July, already is prepared to challenge <COREF ID='58' REF='54'>the regulation</COREF> in <COREF ID='59' REF='41'>court</COREF> .
"What <COREF ID='60' REF='38'>they</COREF> 're doing is clearly unconstitutional," says Bill Fitzpatrick, <COREF ID='61' REF='59'>general counsel</COREF> for the SIA.
"There will be a legal challenge."
<COREF ID='63' REF='61'>Mr. Fitzpatrick</COREF> says <COREF ID='64' REF='59'>the Supreme Court</COREF> ruled in <COREF ID='65' REF='X102'>June 1987</COREF> that states are pre-empted from taking any action against <COREF ID='66' REF='48'>arbitration</COREF> in securities cases.
James C. Meyer, <COREF ID='67' REF='46'>president of the North American Securities Administrators Association</COREF> , disagrees.
The Supreme Court ruling, <COREF ID='69' REF='67'>he</COREF> says, said only that <COREF ID='70' REF='45'>brokers</COREF> can require <COREF ID='71' REF='53'>customers</COREF> to sign <COREF ID='72' REF='49'>arbitration agreements</COREF> .
" <COREF ID='73' REF='10'>It</COREF> doesn't say <COREF ID='74' REF='72'>arbitration agreements</COREF> are OK and everyone should sign on," <COREF ID='75' REF='63'>Mr. Meyer</COREF> says.</TXT>
