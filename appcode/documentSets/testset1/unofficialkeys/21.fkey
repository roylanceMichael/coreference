<COREF ID="5" REF="X4">A Valujet DC-9 jetliner</COREF> with <COREF ID="7" REF="X3">109 people</COREF> aboard crashed in the
<COREF ID="8" REF="X5">Florida Everglades</COREF> shortly after takeoff from <COREF ID="X7">Miami International
Airport</COREF> on Saturday afternoon. Aviation and rescue officials found
<COREF ID="X8">widely scattered debris</COREF> and said there were apparently no
survivors.


Bound for <COREF ID="X9">Atlanta</COREF>, <COREF ID="9" REF="5">the twin-engine aircraft</COREF> was about 30 miles
northwest of <COREF ID="70" REF="X7">Miami airport</COREF> when the pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit, <COREF ID="X11">a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration</COREF> said.
<COREF ID="12" REF="9">The plane</COREF> was believed to be turning back to <COREF ID="13" REF="70">the airport</COREF> when radar
contact was lost shortly after 2 p.m.


``<COREF ID="X18">We</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="15" REF="12">the aircraft</COREF> is down somewhere in the vicinity
of the <COREF ID="16" REF="8">Florida Everglades</COREF>,'' the <COREF ID="17" REF="X11">FAA spokesman</COREF>, <COREF ID="19" REF="17">Anthony Willett</COREF>, said.


The cause of <COREF ID="20" REF="2">the crash</COREF> was unclear. <COREF ID="X17">Valujet Airlines Inc.</COREF>, which
is based in <COREF ID="22" REF="X9">Atlanta</COREF> and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began
operations in 1993 with an old fleet that has grown to about 50 planes.

<COREF ID="23" REF="X17">It</COREF> has experienced a number of problems, including several
aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but never a crash.


Television pictures from helicopters flying over the <COREF ID="24" REF="16">Everglades</COREF>
at midafternoon showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or
other large sections of <COREF ID="25" REF="15">the plane</COREF>, only what appeared to be <COREF ID="26" REF="X8">widely
scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses and desolate swamps</COREF>. It was unclear how deep the water was.


The <COREF ID="27" REF="X18">FAA</COREF> said <COREF ID="X12">the crash site</COREF> was <COREF ID="29" REF="X12">15 miles west of Opa Locka</COREF>, or
<COREF ID="30" REF="29">about 20 miles northwest of Miami</COREF>. But it was unclear by late Saturday afternoon whether the precise <COREF ID="32" REF="20">crash</COREF> site had been located.


One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of wreckage
or survivors from <COREF ID="X13">Valujet's Flight 592</COREF>, <COREF ID="35" REF="X13">a daily two-hour flight</COREF>
from Miami to <COREF ID="71" REF="47">Atlanta</COREF>.


<COREF ID="38" REF="30">The crash site</COREF> appeared to be inaccessible by road. The Coast
Guard dispatched rescue helicopters and aircraft to <COREF ID="40" REF="38">the site</COREF>, and
airboats were being mustered to carry rescue and other emergency
personnel to <COREF ID="41" REF="40">the area</COREF>.


<COREF ID="42" REF="23">Valujet</COREF> said in a statement that <COREF ID="43" REF="25">the plane</COREF> was carrying <COREF ID="44" REF="7">104
passengers and a crew of five</COREF>. Earlier reports had said that as
many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.


<COREF ID="X14">Valujet's fleet</COREF>, said to be <COREF ID="46" REF="X14">the oldest in the industry</COREF>, has run
into a series of problems in the last two and a half years, the
most serious being <COREF ID="X15">a fire</COREF> on June 8 last year that destroyed a DC-9
on a runway in <COREF ID="47" REF="22">Atlanta</COREF>.


A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were
reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.


<COREF ID="X16">An FAA investigation</COREF> in the wake of <COREF ID="49" REF="X15">the fire</COREF> found ``a
significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by <COREF ID="50" REF="42">Valujet</COREF> as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers.''


<COREF ID="51" REF="X16">The inquiry</COREF> said <COREF ID="52" REF="50">Valujet</COREF>'s rapid expansion from two to 48 planes
had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving
inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently
trained flight attendants.
