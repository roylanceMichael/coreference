<COREF ID='1' REF='X2'>A federal mediator</COREF> is trying to reconcile the <COREF ID='2' REF='X16'>New York Stock Exchange</COREF> and about 1,300 of its <COREF ID='3' REF='1'>clerical and operations staff members</COREF> , whose <COREF ID='4' REF='X7'>union</COREF> contract expired Saturday night.

<COREF ID='5' REF='X2'>The mediator</COREF> has imposed a news blackout on the two sides, so a Big Board spokesman couldn't comment on the <COREF ID='7' REF='X2'>talks</COREF> .

<COREF ID='8' REF='X2'>The spokesman</COREF> did say that <COREF ID='9' REF='X2'>the exchange</COREF> would be able to function normally in the event of a walkout.

<COREF ID='10' REF='X2'>The workers</COREF> , <COREF ID='11' REF='X2'>members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153</COREF> , work for <COREF ID='12' REF='X2'>the exchange</COREF> ; for Securities Industry Automation Corp., which operates <COREF ID='13' REF='X2'>the exchange</COREF> 's computers and of which <COREF ID='14' REF='X2'>the Big Board</COREF> owns two-thirds; and for the New York Futures Exchange, <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>a unit of the Big Board</COREF> .

Officials at <COREF ID='17' REF='X2'>the union</COREF> and the <COREF ID='18' REF='1'>Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</COREF> couldn't be reached for comment.

When <COREF ID='19' REF='X2'>the union</COREF> 's previous contract expired in October 1984, <COREF ID='20' REF='X2'>the union</COREF> kept working for eight months without a contract until an agreement was reached in June 1985.
