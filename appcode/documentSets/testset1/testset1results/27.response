<COREF ID='3' REF='X2'>A six-month confrontation</COREF> between Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and <COREF ID='X22'>a technicians union</COREF> appears to be ending, in plenty of time for the fall season.

<COREF ID='6' REF='3'>ABC</COREF> said more than 2,000 out of about 2,150 employees belonging to <COREF ID='7' REF='X22'>the union</COREF> have ratified a new four-year contract.

A few small work units rejected <COREF ID='8' REF='7'>the contract</COREF> , <COREF ID='9' REF='3'>ABC</COREF> said, but are expected to be persuaded to approve <COREF ID='10' REF='6'>it</COREF> soon.

A <COREF ID='11' REF='X22'>union</COREF> press release said <COREF ID='12' REF='X22'>the union</COREF> will schedule further negotiations "as soon as possible" for <COREF ID='13' REF='7'>the units that rejected the offer</COREF> .

<COREF ID='15' REF='X8'>The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians</COREF> represents mostly engineers, camera operators and tape editors at <COREF ID='16' REF='7'>the network</COREF> .

<COREF ID='17' REF='3'>ABC</COREF> applauded <COREF ID='18' REF='X17'>the new contract</COREF> , which gives the network more flexibility in such areas as hiring temporary crews.

Two years ago, <COREF ID='20' REF='X22'>the union</COREF> and NBC fought over work rules, which led to a 17-week strike.
