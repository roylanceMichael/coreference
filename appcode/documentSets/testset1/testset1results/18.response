<COREF ID='X2'>U.S. Mediator</COREF> Says <COREF ID='X3'>Eastern Negotiations</COREF> Are Progressing and Near Critical Stage

After months of quiet and productive meetings, negotiators in the bitter labor battle at Eastern Airlines are approaching a critical phase in <COREF ID='3' REF='X8'>the talks</COREF> , <COREF ID='4' REF='X2'>a federal mediator</COREF> said.

<COREF ID='5' REF='5'>Harry Bickford</COREF> , who has been supervising the talks in Miami, since last fall, said that <COREF ID='8' REF='8'>representatives</COREF> of <COREF ID='X30'>the company and the International Association of Machinists</COREF> have been meeting almost daily since January and have resolved hundreds of differences.

"We are down to the point that within <COREF ID='X42'>a short time</COREF> <COREF ID='11' REF='X42'>we</COREF> will be coming to <COREF ID='X45'>terms</COREF> with the gut issues," <COREF ID='12' REF='X45'>he</COREF> said.

<COREF ID='13' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> 's comments are the first indication that progress has occurred in <COREF ID='14' REF='X8'>the high-stakes, 16-month confrontation over labor costs</COREF> .

Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is seeking steep wage cuts from its roughly 10,000 machinists and baggage handlers as part of a plan to restore <COREF ID='18' REF='X8'>the ailing carrier</COREF> to profitability, and <COREF ID='19' REF='13'>it</COREF> has shrunk <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>its</COREF> capacity about 13% in the past year while seeking <COREF ID='21' REF='X8'>the cost concessions</COREF> .

In an interview, <COREF ID='22' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> acknowledged that the ever-growing clamor of public demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns and political lobbying have heightened antagonism at the bargaining table.

"Litigation, charges, <COREF ID='X90'>counter-charges</COREF> -- <COREF ID='23' REF='X90'>I</COREF> 'm used to that," said <COREF ID='24' REF='4'>Mr. Bickford, an 18-year mediation veteran</COREF> .

"But <COREF ID='X96'>the extent to which <COREF ID='25' REF='X90'>it</COREF> has gone in this case</COREF> is unparalleled.

<COREF ID='26' REF='X9'>I</COREF> have never faced anything like <COREF ID='27' REF='X96'>it</COREF> ."

Nevertheless, <COREF ID='28' REF='11'>"We</COREF> are still talking," <COREF ID='29' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> asserted, "and have been every day since the 26th of January, with the exception of three periods totaling 10 days."

<COREF ID='30' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> expressed anger at the growing perception that the mediation process was fruitless and futile.

Last week, for instance, <COREF ID='X121'>Florida Gov. Bob Martinez</COREF> issued a news release saying that " <COREF ID='31' REF='24'>mediation</COREF> has reached a stalemate and both sides should be allowed to return to <COREF ID='32' REF='X8'>the bargaining table</COREF> ."

And for <COREF ID='33' REF='3'>their</COREF> part, <COREF ID='34' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> officials continue to lobby for the National Mediation Board to impose a deadline on <COREF ID='35' REF='X8'>the talks</COREF> , without which <COREF ID='X134'>management</COREF> contends an agreement on a wage-concession package is all but impossible.

Under U.S. labor law applying to airlines, the mediator may declare an impasse and begin a 30-day countdown, after which management may unilaterally impose <COREF ID='37' REF='19'>its</COREF> last contract offer and <COREF ID='X146'>the union</COREF> is free to strike.

"I don't believe <COREF ID='X148'>there</COREF> is any prospect of getting <COREF ID='38' REF='X9'>a negotiated settlement</COREF> ," said <COREF ID='39' REF='39'>Phil Bakes</COREF> , <COREF ID='40' REF='X3'>president and chief executive officer of Eastern</COREF> , "until there is a firm date when the existing contract comes to an end."

<COREF ID='43' REF='X8'>The union</COREF> says that <COREF ID='44' REF='X148'>it</COREF> is bargaining seriously and that each side has made concessions.

<COREF ID='45' REF='X9'>A settlement through mediation</COREF> is possible, "absolutely," said Charles Bryan, <COREF ID='46' REF='X3'>head of the machinists' union at Eastern</COREF> .

" <COREF ID='49' REF='X9'>I</COREF> have never called <COREF ID='X179'>a strike</COREF> at <COREF ID='50' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> ," <COREF ID='51' REF='X179'>he</COREF> said.

Indeed, <COREF ID='52' REF='X8'>the Machinists union</COREF> -- as well as the pilot and flight attendant unions at <COREF ID='53' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> , from whom <COREF ID='54' REF='X134'>management</COREF> will also seek concessions in the coming months -- is anxious to avoid <COREF ID='55' REF='X9'>a strike</COREF> .

<COREF ID='56' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> has made elaborate preparations to keep <COREF ID='57' REF='X8'>the airline</COREF> flying with non-union workers.

Even as <COREF ID='58' REF='3'>talks</COREF> continue under <COREF ID='59' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> , neither side shows any sign of relenting in public.

Last week, <COREF ID='60' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> ran newspaper advertising featuring Frank Borman, <COREF ID='61' REF='X3'>the former astronaut and former Eastern president</COREF> , saying the federal investigation of Texas Air resulted from a union "whisper campaign" alleging <COREF ID='65' REF='X8'>the airline</COREF> is unsafe.

<COREF ID='X218'>A week</COREF> earlier, <COREF ID='66' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> sued the <COREF ID='67' REF='X30'>Machinist</COREF> and <COREF ID='68' REF='X146'>pilot unions</COREF> , accusing <COREF ID='69' REF='X218'>them</COREF> of a criminal conspiracy to drive down <COREF ID='70' REF='X8'>Texas Air</COREF> 's stock price.

<COREF ID='71' REF='X3'>Eastern</COREF> and <COREF ID='72' REF='X8'>Texas Air</COREF> are also urging employees and shareholders to write their members of Congress demanding that <COREF ID='73' REF='X8'>the National Mediation Board</COREF> begin the 30-day countdown in <COREF ID='74' REF='X8'>the talks</COREF> .

And Thursday, about 3,000 <COREF ID='75' REF='X146'>union</COREF> members took part in a lunch-time demonstration in downtown Miami against <COREF ID='76' REF='X8'>Texas Air</COREF> and <COREF ID='77' REF='X121'>Gov. Martinez</COREF> .

<COREF ID='78' REF='5'>Mr. Bickford</COREF> said <COREF ID='79' REF='78'>he</COREF> was so upset by the level and tenor of the recent clamor, that <COREF ID='80' REF='X8'>the talks</COREF> were moved for a period in April from Miami, where <COREF ID='X256'>Eastern</COREF> is based, to Boston, where <COREF ID='83' REF='X256'>he</COREF> hoped things would be quieter.
