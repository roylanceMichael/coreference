<COREF ID='X21'>A federal judge in Pittsburgh</COREF> issued <COREF ID='X24'>a temporary restraining order</COREF> preventing <COREF ID='3' REF='X19'>Trans World Airlines</COREF> from buying <COREF ID='4' REF='X4'>additional shares of USAir Group Inc.</COREF>

<COREF ID='6' REF='X24'>The order</COREF> , requested in a suit filed by <COREF ID='7' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> , dealt <COREF ID='8' REF='X7'>another blow</COREF> to TWA's bid to buy the company for $52 a share.

<COREF ID='12' REF='X4'>Washington-based USAir</COREF> , which reached <COREF ID='X44'>an agreement</COREF> Friday to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc., yesterday began a $69 a share tender offer for all the stock outstanding of Winston-Salem, N.C.,-based Piedmont.

The <COREF ID='14' REF='14'>proposed transaction</COREF> has an indicated value of $1.59 billion.

Carl C. Icahn, <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>chairman of TWA</COREF> , wouldn't say whether <COREF ID='17' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> would continue its attempt to take over <COREF ID='201' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

<COREF ID='20' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> disclosed last week that <COREF ID='21' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> already had become <COREF ID='22' REF='X4'>USAir's largest shareholder</COREF> , with a 15% stake as of Friday.

Some Wall Street sources and airline industry analysts said they doubted that <COREF ID='24' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> would press <COREF ID='25' REF='6'>the attempt</COREF> if <COREF ID='26' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> buys <COREF ID='27' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> .

"I don't think ( <COREF ID='28' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> ) has the wherewithal" to buy <COREF ID='29' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID='30' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> combined, said Louis Marckesano, <COREF ID='31' REF='X2'>a securities analyst</COREF> at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. <COREF ID='32' REF='20'>Mr. Marckesano</COREF> said <COREF ID='33' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID='34' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> would need an estimated $3.5 billion to acquire <COREF ID='35' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> once the merger with <COREF ID='36' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> is completed.

But <COREF ID='37' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> , as expected, yesterday filed <COREF ID='X103'>a second application</COREF> with <COREF ID='X104'>the Department of Transportation for permission</COREF> to acquire <COREF ID='205' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

The <COREF ID='40' REF='X104'>department</COREF> last week rejected TWA's first application as "deficient" because <COREF ID='42' REF='37'>it</COREF> omitted such important information as the merger's potential impact on competition and pricing.

" <COREF ID='43' REF='40'>It</COREF> 's a <COREF ID='44' REF='X103'>serious application</COREF> ," a <COREF ID='45' REF='X104'>department</COREF> official said of the <COREF ID='46' REF='46'>new filing</COREF> .

Even so, Wall Street and airline industry sources have continued to view TWA's bid for <COREF ID='202' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> skeptically, seeing <COREF ID='50' REF='43'>it</COREF> as a ploy to pressure <COREF ID='51' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> into buying <COREF ID='52' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> .

That view was supported in a <COREF ID='53' REF='53'>tender-offer</COREF> document filed by <COREF ID='54' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in another document filed in court.

The filings gave details of conversations between <COREF ID='55' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and Edwin I. Colodny, <COREF ID='56' REF='X21'>chairman and chief executive officer</COREF> of <COREF ID='203' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

<COREF ID='58' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> said in <COREF ID='59' REF='6'>the filings</COREF> that <COREF ID='60' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> first contacted <COREF ID='61' REF='20'>Mr. Colodny</COREF> last September to discuss the benefits of combining <COREF ID='62' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID='63' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> -- either by <COREF ID='64' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> 's acquisition of <COREF ID='65' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> , or <COREF ID='66' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> 's acquisition of <COREF ID='67' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> .

On Feb. 21, after the <COREF ID='68' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> bid for <COREF ID='69' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> , <COREF ID='70' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> again called <COREF ID='71' REF='20'>Mr. Colodny</COREF> , according to <COREF ID='72' REF='6'>the documents</COREF> .

<COREF ID='73' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> , <COREF ID='74' REF='6'>the documents</COREF> said, told <COREF ID='75' REF='20'>Mr. Colodny</COREF> that a merger between Piedmont and USAir would put <COREF ID='78' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> in a tough competitive position.

<COREF ID='79' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> reportedly said <COREF ID='80' REF='79'>he</COREF> "couldn't watch that happen."

<COREF ID='81' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> then proposed that <COREF ID='82' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> buy <COREF ID='83' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> , or that TWA buy <COREF ID='84' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

While <COREF ID='85' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> is known to have approached several investment bankers in the last week, seeking advice on how to proceed with <COREF ID='86' REF='X2'>TWA's offer for USAir</COREF> , <COREF ID='X203'>Wall Street sources</COREF> say <COREF ID='89' REF='X203'>he</COREF> hasn't retained any investment banking firm in connection with <COREF ID='90' REF='X8'>the bid</COREF> .

Nevertheless, sources close to <COREF ID='91' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID='92' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> weren't willing to claim victory over <COREF ID='93' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID='94' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> , even though the <COREF ID='95' REF='27'>tender offer for Piedmont</COREF> has begun.

" <COREF ID='97' REF='97'>Carl</COREF> is a tenacious fellow," said a source close to <COREF ID='98' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

" <COREF ID='99' REF='6'>He</COREF> doesn't give up easily and <COREF ID='X222'>one</COREF> should never underestimate what <COREF ID='100' REF='X222'>he</COREF> can or will do."

<COREF ID='101' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> couldn't be reached for comment.

Sources familiar with <COREF ID='102' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID='103' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> said that, so far, <COREF ID='104' REF='X19'>the airline</COREF> is taking a loss on <COREF ID='105' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> shares it bought late last week.

<COREF ID='106' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> is understood to have held a 4.9% stake in <COREF ID='107' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> for nearly a year before increasing <COREF ID='108' REF='42'>its</COREF> position to 15% in recent weeks.

A source close to <COREF ID='109' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> said that the latest stake was bought at prices ranging from about $48.50 a share to more than $50 a share.

That would indicate that <COREF ID='110' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> has taken a loss of more than $5 million on its <COREF ID='111' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> shares.

<COREF ID='112' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> stock closed at $28, down $2.50 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.

<COREF ID='113' REF='6'>The drop</COREF> reduced the market value of the 22 million shares that <COREF ID='114' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and an <COREF ID='115' REF='20'>Icahn</COREF> -led investor group hold in <COREF ID='116' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> by some $55 million.

<COREF ID='117' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> stock fell $3.375 to close at $47.75, and <COREF ID='118' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> declined 62.5 cents to $67.625.

Wall Street traders said <COREF ID='119' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> shares fell partly because of market uncertainty about federal regulatory approval for a <COREF ID='120' REF='X4'>merger with USAir</COREF> .

But sources close to <COREF ID='122' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> said they didn't believe there would be any problem obtaining approval for <COREF ID='123' REF='6'>the merger</COREF> and pointed out that <COREF ID='124' REF='6'>the company</COREF> plans to complete <COREF ID='125' REF='42'>its tender</COREF> Paragraphing Error

Sources close to <COREF ID='127' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID='128' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> conceded that if <COREF ID='129' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF>

is permitted to buy more <COREF ID='130' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> shares, it certainly has

enough cash, an estimated $900 million, to do so. Of that

money, about $150 million is committed to the purchase of USX

Corp. shares, in which <COREF ID='131' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> currently owns an 11.4%

stake.

<COREF ID='132' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> hasn't yet filed documents with the <COREF ID='133' REF='133'>SEC</COREF> in connection with <COREF ID='134' REF='42'>its</COREF> <COREF ID='135' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> holding, and it isn't known how much of <COREF ID='136' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> 's money is committed to buying <COREF ID='137' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> shares.

Separately, in its SEC filing, <COREF ID='140' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> disclosed details of <COREF ID='141' REF='42'>its</COREF> plans for financing <COREF ID='142' REF='6'>the Piedmont acquisition</COREF> .

<COREF ID='144' REF='6'>The company</COREF> said <COREF ID='145' REF='140'>it</COREF> received a letter from New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Friday indicating the <COREF ID='146' REF='X44'>bank</COREF> 's willingness to provide as much as $500 million for <COREF ID='147' REF='6'>the purchase</COREF> .

<COREF ID='148' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID='149' REF='149'>Manufacturers Hanover</COREF> also is willing to act as agent to raise the remainder of the funds.

<COREF ID='150' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID='151' REF='148'>it</COREF> expects to borrow as much as $2 billion from banks to complete <COREF ID='152' REF='6'>the acquisition</COREF> .

<COREF ID='153' REF='150'>It</COREF> then plans to refinance the bank loans with proceeds from public or private equity and subordinated debt offerings.

<COREF ID='154' REF='X19'>The airline</COREF> also said in <COREF ID='155' REF='6'>the filing</COREF> that <COREF ID='156' REF='153'>it</COREF> expects to keep <COREF ID='157' REF='27'>Piedmont</COREF> 's headquarters in Winston-Salem.

<COREF ID='158' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> said that William R. Howard, <COREF ID='159' REF='X4'>chairman and chief executive of Piedmont</COREF> , will be elected president of <COREF ID='161' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> after <COREF ID='162' REF='6'>the merger</COREF> is completed.

Lawyers for <COREF ID='163' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID='164' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> are due back in court in Pittsburgh this morning to determine whether <COREF ID='165' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> can proceed to buy more USAir stock.

<COREF ID='167' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> has asked <COREF ID='168' REF='6'>the court</COREF> to issue a preliminary injunction, enjoining <COREF ID='169' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> from buying <COREF ID='170' REF='X4'>more USAir shares</COREF> and from interfering with <COREF ID='172' REF='X4'>USAir's tender offer for Piedmont stock</COREF> .

<COREF ID='175' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> argues that <COREF ID='176' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID='177' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> violated <COREF ID='X401'>the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act</COREF> by buying more than $15 million of <COREF ID='178' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> stock without first receiving regulatory approvals.

<COREF ID='179' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> also alleges that <COREF ID='180' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID='181' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> weren't entitled to buy more than 10% of <COREF ID='182' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> 's stock without first receiving permission from the <COREF ID='183' REF='X104'>Transportation Department</COREF> .

<COREF ID='X415'>A lawyer</COREF> for <COREF ID='184' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID='185' REF='20'>Mr. Icahn</COREF> , in an affidavit, denied that <COREF ID='186' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> has done anything wrong by buying a 15% stake in <COREF ID='187' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> .

<COREF ID='188' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> says that <COREF ID='189' REF='X415'>it</COREF> isn't subject to <COREF ID='190' REF='X401'>Hart-Scott-Rodino</COREF> regulations and must only seek approval from the <COREF ID='191' REF='X104'>Transportation Department</COREF> .

<COREF ID='X428'>Lawyers</COREF> for <COREF ID='192' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> said that the voting-trust application they filed with the <COREF ID='193' REF='X104'>department</COREF> Wednesday allows <COREF ID='194' REF='X19'>the airline</COREF> to buy <COREF ID='195' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> stock while a separate application to acquire control of <COREF ID='196' REF='X4'>USAir</COREF> is considered.

Indeed, <COREF ID='197' REF='X2'>TWA</COREF> contends that Houston-based Texas Air Corp. bought more than 9.9% of Eastern Airlines -- which <COREF ID='198' REF='X428'>it</COREF> later acquired entirely -- before the <COREF ID='199' REF='X104'>department</COREF> approved <COREF ID='200' REF='X4'>Texas Air</COREF> 's application to create a trust to hold the shares.
