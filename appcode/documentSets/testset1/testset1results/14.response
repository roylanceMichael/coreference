<COREF ID='5' REF='X2'>The rise in labor costs and wage settlements</COREF> , which has been narrowing for most of the decade, leveled off <COREF ID='11' REF='X8'>last year</COREF> , <COREF ID='X22'>the Labor Department</COREF> said.

Total compensation costs in private industry, including pay and benefits, rose 3.3% <COREF ID='13' REF='X8'>last year</COREF> after a 3.2% increase in 1986, <COREF ID='14' REF='5'>the department</COREF> said.

The increase in <COREF ID='15' REF='5'>these costs</COREF> had been getting smaller <COREF ID='X37'>each year</COREF> since 1981, when <COREF ID='16' REF='X37'>they</COREF> rose 9.8%, <COREF ID='17' REF='5'>the same as in 1980</COREF> .

Meanwhile, collective bargaining agreements reached last year called for an average 2.2% wage increase in the first year of the contract and 2.1% annually over the life of the pact.

<COREF ID='X56'>The industries</COREF> surveyed agreed to <COREF ID='X57'>the same percentage pay</COREF> raises when they last reached contract accords, <COREF ID='26' REF='5'>the department</COREF> said.

<COREF ID='X61'>Officials</COREF> said <COREF ID='27' REF='X56'>it</COREF> 's <COREF ID='28' REF='5'>the first time</COREF> since 1982 that current contract settlements didn't provide lower average wage adjustments than the bargaining agreements they replaced.

The <COREF ID='34' REF='X6'>wage</COREF> agreements reached <COREF ID='35' REF='X8'>last year</COREF> also were higher than the average <COREF ID='36' REF='X57'>pay</COREF> rises bargained in <COREF ID='37' REF='17'>1986</COREF> , when a 1.2% increase in the first contract year and a 1.8% annual increase during <COREF ID='40' REF='5'>the life of the settlements</COREF> were the smallest increases recorded during the 20 years <COREF ID='43' REF='X2'>the Labor Department</COREF> has collected the statistics.

<COREF ID='44' REF='X22'>Department officials</COREF> said <COREF ID='46' REF='X6'>this year's higher wage increases</COREF> don't necessarily indicate a trend.

A tighter labor market in the services sector may be part of the reason the compensation increases have leveled off, <COREF ID='50' REF='X61'>officials</COREF> said.

A tighter <COREF ID='51' REF='X2'>labor</COREF> market would allow employees to demand higher pay and benefits.

In its report on major collective bargaining agreements, <COREF ID='53' REF='5'>the department</COREF> said that the average increase was reduced by lump-sum payments, which are one-time payments often made upon a contract's ratification.

<COREF ID='56' REF='5'>The payments</COREF> often are provided instead of <COREF ID='57' REF='X6'>wage</COREF> increases, but <COREF ID='58' REF='57'>they</COREF> aren't included in <COREF ID='59' REF='X6'>wages</COREF> and aren't used as a base for future increases.

About half of the workers covered by big <COREF ID='60' REF='X2'>labor</COREF> contracts <COREF ID='61' REF='X8'>last year</COREF> received <COREF ID='62' REF='5'>these payments</COREF> .

<COREF ID='X134'>Better-than-average <COREF ID='63' REF='X6'>wage</COREF> settlements for construction industry workers -- specifically those in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions --</COREF> were largely responsible for stopping the narrowing trend.

<COREF ID='64' REF='X134'>Construction</COREF> pacts settled in <COREF ID='65' REF='17'>1987</COREF> averaged 2.9% increases in the first contract year and 3.1% annually.

All other industries surveyed <COREF ID='68' REF='X8'>last year</COREF> , including the automobile, food store and steel industries, averaged 2.1% increases in <COREF ID='69' REF='X8'>the first contract year</COREF> and 1.9% annually.

About two million workers were covered by <COREF ID='71' REF='X6'>agreements reached last year</COREF> .
