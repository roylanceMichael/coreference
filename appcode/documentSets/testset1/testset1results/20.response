<COREF ID='2' REF='X2'>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</COREF> appears to be pulling back from the brink of <COREF ID='3' REF='X5'>a possible price war</COREF> .

After recent major price declines because of a sharp rise in OPEC production, <COREF ID='7' REF='7'>total cartel output</COREF> has now dropped as much as one million barrels a day -- from the year's peak of 20 million barrels a day early this month.

And there are <COREF ID='X38'>new indications</COREF> that even <COREF ID='10' REF='2'>the United Arab Emirates</COREF> , <COREF ID='11' REF='X2'>OPEC's most notable quota violator</COREF> , might soon cut <COREF ID='X43'>its own output</COREF> below a targeted 1.5 million barrels a day because of pressure from others in <COREF ID='15' REF='2'>the cartel</COREF> , including Saudi Arabia.

<COREF ID='16' REF='2'>The Emirates</COREF> aren't making any promises publicly.

But its government did offer conciliatory gestures to OPEC yesterday.

<COREF ID='19' REF='2'>The gestures</COREF> followed the arrival in Abu Dhabi of OPEC's new secretary-general, <COREF ID='21' REF='21'>Subroto</COREF> .

<COREF ID='22' REF='21'>Mr. Subroto</COREF> delivered a letter to Sheik Zayed Al Nahyyan, <COREF ID='23' REF='2'>the Emirates' ruler</COREF> , from Rilwanu Lukman, <COREF ID='25' REF='X2'>Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president</COREF> , voicing concern over <COREF ID='29' REF='2'>the Emirates</COREF> ' recent renunciation of its assigned quota of 948,000 barrels a day.

<COREF ID='X90'>The chief conciliatory note at the round of talks with Mr. Subroto</COREF> came from <COREF ID='33' REF='33'>Sheik Zayed</COREF> , who "reaffirmed" the Emirates' support for OPEC's "unity and cohesion."

According to the Emirates' official news agency, <COREF ID='37' REF='2'>the ruler</COREF> also noted that <COREF ID='38' REF='X43'>his country</COREF> "has always been at the forefront for boosting <COREF ID='40' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> decisions and supporting the stability of the market."

The <COREF ID='41' REF='X38'>news agency</COREF> report didn't mention <COREF ID='42' REF='2'>the Emirates' production level</COREF> .

But senior oil officials in <COREF ID='45' REF='2'>the Emirates</COREF> were quoted by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report <COREF ID='46' REF='46'>yesterday</COREF> as saying that while <COREF ID='47' REF='2'>the government</COREF> isn't backing down on <COREF ID='48' REF='X43'>its</COREF> demand for a higher <COREF ID='49' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> quota, <COREF ID='50' REF='42'>current production</COREF> is well under <COREF ID='51' REF='2'>the target</COREF> .

Industry estimates generally place <COREF ID='52' REF='2'>the Emirates' current production</COREF> at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels <COREF ID='54' REF='X5'>a day</COREF> .

Until recently, <COREF ID='X135'>such excess output by the Emirates</COREF> would have been ignored.

But <COREF ID='56' REF='X135'>it</COREF> became an issue for <COREF ID='57' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> -- as well as for the world oil markets -- last month, when Emirates' officials went <COREF ID='X151'>public</COREF> with <COREF ID='60' REF='X151'>their</COREF> intent to renounce <COREF ID='61' REF='X8'>their quota</COREF> .

That not only focused new attention on <COREF ID='63' REF='X2'>OPEC output</COREF> , which had begun climbing in late June, as previously reported, but <COREF ID='65' REF='56'>it</COREF> also raised concern among other exporters.

With Iraq also excluded from <COREF ID='66' REF='2'>the system</COREF> as <COREF ID='X165'>a result of fallout</COREF> from <COREF ID='67' REF='X43'>its</COREF> war with Iran, " <COREF ID='68' REF='X165'>they</COREF> are afraid that if <COREF ID='69' REF='X5'>the UAE</COREF> continues outside there will be no control over <COREF ID='70' REF='2'>the others</COREF> ," said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on <COREF ID='71' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> affairs.

In addition to <COREF ID='72' REF='21'>Mr. Subroto</COREF> 's visit to <COREF ID='73' REF='X5'>Abu Dhabi</COREF> , <COREF ID='74' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> 's <COREF ID='75' REF='X5'>price</COREF> -monitoring committee of five leading <COREF ID='76' REF='25'>oil</COREF> ministers also is tentatively scheduled to meet next Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address the problem of <COREF ID='77' REF='2'>the Emirates</COREF> ' unilateral <COREF ID='78' REF='X8'>quota</COREF> decision, and to review <COREF ID='79' REF='X5'>world oil prices</COREF> .

But <COREF ID='81' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> 's headquarters <COREF ID='82' REF='46'>yesterday</COREF> still declined to confirm details of the meeting.

" <COREF ID='83' REF='81'>It</COREF> 's tentative because <COREF ID='84' REF='81'>it</COREF> depends on the outcome of <COREF ID='85' REF='X5'>the talks in the UAE</COREF> ," said an <COREF ID='87' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> spokesman.

Meanwhile, <COREF ID='88' REF='X2'>total OPEC output</COREF> has dropped as much as 5% after <COREF ID='90' REF='2'>the recent run-up</COREF> -- with <COREF ID='91' REF='10'>Saudi Arabia</COREF> , <COREF ID='92' REF='2'>the cartel's biggest producer</COREF> , pacing the declines.

PetroLogistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that closely monitors <COREF ID='94' REF='X2'>OPEC output</COREF> , estimates production for July had averaged just over 19 million barrels a day after reaching <COREF ID='97' REF='X2'>20 million barrels a day in the first week of the month</COREF> .

<COREF ID='100' REF='X90'>That</COREF> 's in line with demand for <COREF ID='101' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> oil for the second half, according to a current report on <COREF ID='102' REF='25'>world oil markets</COREF> by Charles L. McSpadden, <COREF ID='104' REF='X2'>manager of petroleum analysis</COREF> , and Antonio M. Szabo, <COREF ID='106' REF='X2'>manager of petroleum planning</COREF> , at Bonner @amp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston.

" <COREF ID='108' REF='X5'>The 19 million barrels a day</COREF> is in <COREF ID='110' REF='X2'>OPEC</COREF> 's comfort zone," said <COREF ID='111' REF='22'>Mr. Szabo</COREF> .
