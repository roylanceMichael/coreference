NAVY BLAMES SHOWING OFF FOR JET CRASH

WASHINGTON  -  The Navy said Friday that a pilot was probably
showing off for his parents when he crashed an F-14A jet fighter in
Nashville in January, killing himself, a fellow officer and three
people on the ground.


The pilot, Lt. Comdr. John Stacy Bates, had been grounded for a
month in April 1995 after he lost control of another F-14A after
taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln. The plane crashed
after the pilot and his crew ejected. The crew members were
rescued.


Rear Adm. Bernard Smith, who investigated the Nashville crash,
said Bates' judgment was influenced by his parents' presence at the
field" and his desire to show them risky takeoff and flight
maneuvers.


The admiral said that in taking off from the Nashville airport
on Jan. 29, Bates ascended at an angle steeper than 50 degrees,
violating Navy rules.


After the near-perpendicular takeoff, in the clouds, Smith said,
the pilot became disoriented, and in all likelihood did not realize
that he was heading earthward until his jet pierced the clouds at
2,300 feet.


By then, the admiral said, it was too late to prevent the plane
from smashing into the house of Elmer and Ada Newsom.


In addition to Bates, 33, and his radar intercept officer, Lt.
Graham Alden Higgins, 28, those killed were the Newsoms and Ewing
Wair, who was visiting them.


The crash would never have happened had the pilot made a normal
take-off or taken the cloudy weather into account, Smith said after
an 11-week review of the incident.
