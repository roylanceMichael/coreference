 Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_. 
 Chagas disease following organ transplantation has occurred in Latin 
 America, where Chagas disease is endemic, but it has not yet been reported 
 in the United States.
 A report in the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
 <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm> describes three 
 cases in the United States of _T. cruzi_ infection associated with 
 transplantation of solid organs from the same donor. The Centers for 
 Disease Control and Prevention will collaborate with US transplant 
 organizations to discuss whether to screen potential donors for _T. cruzi_ 
 infection and, if so, which donors to screen, how to screen, and what to do 
 if the screening tests are positive.
 [Infection with _T. cruzi_ can be activated during immunosuppression in 
 organ recipients and can be transferred with the organ to the recipient. 
 The first situation is well known in countries where _T. cruzi_ is common, 
 especially after bone marrow transplantation. The second situation has been 
 described several times after renal transplants where the kidney came from 
 a _T. cruzi_ infected donor. The three cases in the US all refer to organs 
 from the same donor, and the comment on the CDC website emphasises that 
 organ transplants save life and that medical personnel should be aware that 
 Chagas disease is one of the possible risks associated with organ 
 transplantation. ï¿½ Mod.EP]
