A Valujet DC-9 jetliner with 109 people aboard crashed in the
Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami International
Airport on Saturday afternoon. Aviation and rescue officials found
widely scattered debris and said there were apparently no
survivors.


Bound for Atlanta, the twin-engine aircraft was about 30 miles
northwest of Miami airport when the pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The plane was believed to be turning back to the airport when radar
contact was lost shortly after 2 p.m.


"We believe that the aircraft is down somewhere in the vicinity
of the Florida Everglades," the FAA spokesman, Anthony Willett,
said.


The cause of the crash was unclear. Valujet Airlines Inc., which
is based in Atlanta and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began
operations in 1993 with an old fleet that has grown to about 50
planes.


It has experienced a number of problems, including several
aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but
never a crash.


Television pictures from helicopters flying over the Everglades
at midafternoon showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or
other large sections of the plane, only what appeared to be widely
scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses
and desolate swamps. It was unclear how deep the water was.


The FAA said the crash site was 15 miles west of Opa Locka, or
about 20 miles northwest of Miami. But it was unclear by late
Saturday afternoon whether the precise crash site had been located.


One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be
scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of wreckage
or survivors from Valujet's Flight 592, a daily two-hour flight
from Miami to Atlanta.


The crash site appeared to be inaccessible by road. The Coast
Guard dispatched rescue helicopters and aircraft to the site, and
airboats were being mustered to carry rescue and other emergency
personnel to the area.


Valujet said in a statement that the plane was carrying 104
passengers and a crew of five. Earlier reports had said that as
many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.


Valujet's fleet, said to be the oldest in the industry, has run
into a series of problems in the last two and a half years, the
most serious being a fire on June 8 last year that destroyed a DC-9
on a runway in Atlanta.


A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were
reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.


An FAA investigation in the wake of the fire found "a
significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by Valujet as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers."


The inquiry said Valujet's rapid expansion from two to 48 planes
had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving
inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently
trained flight attendants.
