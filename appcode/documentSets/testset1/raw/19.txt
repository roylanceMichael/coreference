TEXTRON DISCUSSING SALE OF PAUL REVERE UNIT TO PROVIDENT COS.

Providence, Rhode Island, April 24 (Bloomberg) -- Textron Inc.
is discussing the sale of its Paul Revere Corp. disability
insurance unit to Provident Cos. Inc. for about $1 billion, a
person familiar with the talks said.


The talks are part of Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron's
efforts to shed financial services units and focus on core
manufacturing businesses, which include making Cessna aircraft,
Bell helicopters and E-Z-GO golf carts.


For Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Provident, an acquisition would
be the latest step in the company's effort to reorganize and expand
through insuring policyholders against loss of income if they
suffer a debilitating accident or illness.


Textron Chief Financial Officer Stephen Key declined to comment
on the likelihood of selling Paul Revere. His company "has been
saying all along" that it plans to reduce its presence in
financial services, he said, declining to elaborate.


Provident wouldn't comment on any potential acquisitions.
Provident Vice President Thomas White said, "We have said it is
our strategy to grow Provident."


News of the talks was reported in today's Wall Street Journal.
Provident stock fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in early trading. Textron shares
rose 3/4 to 88 7/8.


Officials at Paul Revere weren't available for comment. Its
shares rose 3/4 to 25.


Worcester, Massachusetts-based Paul Revere, 83 percent owned by
Textron, has been a laggard among Textron's six operating units,
and especially among its finance-oriented businesses. In 1995,
revenue at Paul Revere rose 14 percent to $1.52 billion while
operating income dropped 6 percent to $123 million. Revenue also
rose as income declined in 1994.


While Paul Revere has had trouble with rising benefit costs,
results are just the opposite at Textron's Avco Financial Services
unit, a consumer finance company, and Textron Financial Corp., a
commercial finance company.


Revenue in Avco and Textron Financial rose 19 percent last year
on a combined basis to $1.99 billion, with operating income
increasing 10 percent to $365 million.


Given the performance at Paul Revere, Salomon Brothers analyst
George Shapiro said Textron has been looking "to extricate"
itself from the insurance company in favor of acquiring more
manufacturing businesses.
