STRATFORD, Conn.  -  A helicopter making a test flight before it
was to be delivered to the Marine Corps to provide cargo service
for the White House appeared to lose its rotors on Thursday and
crashed onto the flight field of the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
killing all four crew members.


Hovering at the height of the nearby Sikorsky Bridge, where the
Merritt Parkway crosses the Housatonic River, the CH53E helicopter
-  also known as the Super Stallion for its size and power  -
appeared to be in distress, witnesses said, with smoke issuing from
it before its 40-foot rotors broke off.


"The helicopter was up in the air; it's normal for us to see
them," said John Nasufi, who spotted it as he was loading pizzas
from his restaurant above the river for a lunchtime delivery to the
Sikorsky workers. "The helicopter had smoke coming out, and all of
a sudden it lost its blades, and that was it. It came straight
down."


The explosion shook nearby buildings and stopped traffic on the
bridge, from which the crushed fuselage could be seen burning on
the tarmac less than half a mile away, about 50 feet from the
river. The craft's distress had lasted long enough for one driver
to call a Bridgeport radio station to report that a helicopter was
in trouble.


Sikorsky officials said all four peole on board were employees.
Their names were withheld until relatives could be notified.


A spokeswoman for Sikorsky, Gina McAllister, said the heavy-lift
helicopter, which can carry a payload of 31 tons, was to be
assigned to the Marine base at Quantico, Va. The helicopter would
have been used to ferry limousines and other advance equipment for
the White House. She said it would not have carried the president.


The crash occurred at 11:08 a.m. Witnesses differed as to
whether the craft had burst into flames before it dropped onto the
flight field, or upon impact. But many said that before the craft
fell, its three rotor blades shot off. One landed across the
Housatonic River, which borders the Sikorsky property, one flew
toward the Sikorsky Bridge, and the third fell toward the assembly
plant.


Ms. McAllister said the cause of the crash was not known. With
the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board, she said, Sikorsky Aircraft
would conduct the safety investigation with the participation of
the Navy Safety Center.


The Marine Corps and the Navy have purchased 150 of the
heavy-lift helicopters, which can be used for amphibious assaults,
carrying cargo and recovering aircraft, according to Jane's All the
World's Aircraft. CH53E's were used to rescue Air Force Capt. Scott
O'Grady when he was shot down over Bosnia, and to evacuate the U.S.
embassy in Somalia, Ms. McAllister said.


"This helicopter has a very proud tradition, and the Sikorsky
family is devastated by this mishap," she said.
