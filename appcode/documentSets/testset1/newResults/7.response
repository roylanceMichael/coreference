Emergency Dept. Closed by <COREF ID='X1'>Suspected Outbreak</COREF> of <COREF ID='X2'>Winter Vomiting Disease</COREF>
--------------------------------------------------
.
<COREF ID='1' REF='X1'>An outbreak</COREF> of what is suspected to be <COREF ID='2' REF='X2'>winter vomiting disease</COREF> forced the
<COREF ID='X11'>closure</COREF> of Sunnybrook Hospital's emergency <COREF ID='3' REF='X11'>department</COREF> on Monday morning.
Over the weekend, a number of <COREF ID='X20'>patients and staff</COREF> were stricken by bouts of
<COREF ID='X24'>vomiting</COREF> and diarrhea. By <COREF ID='4' REF='X20'>Monday</COREF> afternoon <COREF ID='5' REF='4'>25 Nov 2002</COREF> , 28 <COREF ID='6' REF='X20'>staff members</COREF> and
13 <COREF ID='7' REF='X20'>patients</COREF> showed <COREF ID='X32'>symptoms</COREF> of the virus infection, which is highly
contagious and spread through person-to-person contact.
"We haven't determined what <COREF ID='8' REF='X24'>the infection</COREF> is yet. <COREF ID='9' REF='X32'>We</COREF> suspect <COREF ID='10' REF='8'>it</COREF> to be a case
of something called <COREF ID='11' REF='2'>winter vomiting disease</COREF> ," <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>hospital</COREF> spokesman Craig
DuHamel said. "Obviously <COREF ID='13' REF='9'>we</COREF> have to be very vigilant to ensure <COREF ID='14' REF='13'>this</COREF> is
contained in <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>our</COREF> emergency <COREF ID='16' REF='3'>department</COREF> ." <COREF ID='X53'>The emergency <COREF ID='17' REF='3'>department</COREF> was</COREF>
expected to be closed until <COREF ID='X57'>the afternoon</COREF> of Wed <COREF ID='18' REF='5'>27 Nov 2002</COREF> at least,
<COREF ID='19' REF='X57'>DuHamel</COREF> said, adding that cleaning crews were on the <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>scene</COREF> with anti-viral
agents [disinfectants?].
Patients walking into <COREF ID='21' REF='X53'>emergency</COREF> were told about <COREF ID='22' REF='21'>the situation</COREF> upon <COREF ID='X66'>arrival</COREF>
and, if <COREF ID='23' REF='X66'>their</COREF> condition was stable, asked to go to another hospital. <COREF ID='X71'>Those</COREF>
who were unable to go to another <COREF ID='24' REF='X71'>facility</COREF> would be treated, <COREF ID='25' REF='12'>the hospital</COREF>
said in a news release. <COREF ID='26' REF='11'>Winter vomiting disease</COREF> is <COREF ID='27' REF='8'>an infection</COREF> caused by a
<COREF ID='X88'>virus commonly</COREF> transmitted from person to person in cold weather, when
people are indoors more often and in closer contact. <COREF ID='28' REF='X32'>Symptoms</COREF> include severe
nausea and <COREF ID='29' REF='X24'>vomiting</COREF> that can last between 24 and 48 hours. <COREF ID='30' REF='19'>DuHamel</COREF> said <COREF ID='31' REF='X88'>the virus</COREF> is not life-threatening and is similar to the Norwalk virus, which has
made headlines recently for sickening hundreds of passengers on the
Florida-based cruise ship
Amsterdam.
[As has been repeatedly stated in ProMED-mail, " <COREF ID='32' REF='26'>winter vomiting disease</COREF> " is
a misnomer. Outbreaks in the UK and Ireland have occurred throughout the
year in hospitals, health care facilities, and schools. In North America
outbreaks on cruise ships have occurred during voyages to Alaska in the
summer and to Caribbean destinations in the winter. Density and hygiene
considerations are probably the relevant determining factors. <COREF ID='33' REF='32'>Winter vomiting disease</COREF> is caused by infection with a <COREF ID='34' REF='33'>Norwalk</COREF> -like <COREF ID='35' REF='31'>virus</COREF> , although
<COREF ID='36' REF='14'>this</COREF> is seldom confirmed microbiologically. <COREF ID='37' REF='34'>Norwalk</COREF> -like <COREF ID='38' REF='35'>viruses</COREF> are <COREF ID='X135'>a</COREF>
heterogenous <COREF ID='39' REF='X135'>group</COREF> of caliciviruses that is now designated as the genus
_ <COREF ID='40' REF='35'>Norovirus</COREF> _. - Mod.CP]
