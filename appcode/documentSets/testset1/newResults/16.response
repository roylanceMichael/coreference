By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau <COREF ID='5' REF='X10'>Two Chinese crew members</COREF>
were killed Tuesday when <COREF ID='X26'>their helicopter</COREF> crashed near <COREF ID='8' REF='X26'>Macau</COREF> .
The China Southern Helicopter Company <COREF ID='9' REF='X26'>aircraft</COREF> was on <COREF ID='10' REF='5'>its</COREF> way to
Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when <COREF ID='11' REF='9'>it</COREF> crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.
Other reports said <COREF ID='13' REF='X26'>the helicopter</COREF> , which went down <COREF ID='X37'>10 to 15</COREF>
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information. <COREF ID='14' REF='X37'>The incident</COREF> fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering <COREF ID='X44'>a search</COREF>
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.
Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>Macau</COREF> Marine
Police in <COREF ID='17' REF='X44'>the search</COREF> for <COREF ID='18' REF='17'>the Sikorsky 76</COREF> . <COREF ID='19' REF='18'>Mainland</COREF> authorities later told <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>the department</COREF> 's Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre <COREF ID='X59'>the wreckage</COREF> had been recovered from
<COREF ID='X62'>the Chinese island</COREF> of <COREF ID='21' REF='X59'>Daiwaishan</COREF> .
``Someone on <COREF ID='22' REF='X62'>the island</COREF> heard a noise and called <COREF ID='23' REF='22'>Zhuhai</COREF> airport
authorities,'' said a <COREF ID='24' REF='16'>Macau</COREF> aviation source. `` <COREF ID='25' REF='4'>China</COREF> sent a
helicopter and confirmed <COREF ID='26' REF='40'>the crash</COREF> on <COREF ID='27' REF='22'>the island</COREF> .'' <COREF ID='28' REF='24'>Macau</COREF> authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said <COREF ID='29' REF='28'>the pilots</COREF> had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''. <COREF ID='30' REF='23'>Zhuhai</COREF> officials confirmed <COREF ID='31' REF='5'>the crew</COREF> had been killed.
Sources suggested that <COREF ID='X92'>poor weather</COREF> was <COREF ID='32' REF='26'>the likely cause of the crash</COREF> .
The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at <COREF ID='34' REF='X92'>the time</COREF> . Rescuers also reported poor visibility. <COREF ID='35' REF='25'>China</COREF> , as <COREF ID='36' REF='35'>the country of registration</COREF> , would investigate <COREF ID='37' REF='14'>the incident</COREF> , the <COREF ID='38' REF='20'>Civil Aviation Department</COREF> said.
