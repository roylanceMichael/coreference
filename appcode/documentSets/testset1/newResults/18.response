<COREF ID='X28'>WASHINGTON</COREF> @amp;MD; The <COREF ID='6' REF='4'>Navy</COREF> said Friday that <COREF ID='7' REF='2'>a pilot</COREF> was probably
showing off for <COREF ID='X30'>his parents</COREF> when <COREF ID='9' REF='X28'>he</COREF> crashed <COREF ID='X31'>an F-14A jet fighter</COREF> in
<COREF ID='X35'>Nashville</COREF> in January, killing <COREF ID='11' REF='X31'>himself</COREF> , <COREF ID='X36'>a fellow officer</COREF> and three
people on the ground. <COREF ID='12' REF='7'>The pilot</COREF> , <COREF ID='13' REF='X30'>Lt. Comdr. John Stacy Bates</COREF> , had been grounded for a
<COREF ID='X47'>month</COREF> in April 1995 after <COREF ID='14' REF='X47'>he</COREF> lost control of another F-14A after
taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln. <COREF ID='15' REF='12'>The plane</COREF> crashed
after <COREF ID='16' REF='12'>the pilot</COREF> and his crew ejected. <COREF ID='18' REF='15'>The crew members</COREF> were
rescued.
Rear Adm. Bernard Smith, who investigated <COREF ID='19' REF='X15'>the Nashville crash</COREF> ,
said <COREF ID='21' REF='13'>Bates</COREF> ' judgment was influenced by <COREF ID='22' REF='X30'>his parents</COREF> ' presence at the
field'' and <COREF ID='24' REF='22'>his</COREF> desire to show <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>them</COREF> risky <COREF ID='X75'>takeoff and flight</COREF>
maneuvers. <COREF ID='26' REF='15'>The admiral</COREF> said that in taking off from the <COREF ID='27' REF='X35'>Nashville</COREF> airport
on Jan. 29, <COREF ID='28' REF='21'>Bates</COREF> ascended at <COREF ID='X83'>an angle steeper</COREF> than 50 degrees,
violating <COREF ID='30' REF='6'>Navy</COREF> rules.
After the near-perpendicular takeoff, in the clouds, <COREF ID='31' REF='X83'>Smith</COREF> said, <COREF ID='32' REF='16'>the pilot</COREF> became disoriented, and in <COREF ID='X89'>all likelihood</COREF> did not realize
that <COREF ID='33' REF='X89'>he</COREF> was heading earthward until <COREF ID='34' REF='25'>his</COREF> <COREF ID='53' REF='X15'>jet</COREF> pierced <COREF ID='35' REF='34'>the clouds</COREF> at 2,300 feet.
By <COREF ID='36' REF='26'>then</COREF> , <COREF ID='37' REF='26'>the admiral</COREF> said, <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>it</COREF> was <COREF ID='39' REF='38'>too late</COREF> to prevent <COREF ID='40' REF='15'>the plane</COREF> from smashing into the house of Elmer and Ada Newsom.
In addition to <COREF ID='41' REF='28'>Bates</COREF> , 33, and <COREF ID='42' REF='X36'>his radar intercept officer</COREF> , <COREF ID='44' REF='13'>Lt. Graham Alden Higgins</COREF> , 28, those killed were <COREF ID='45' REF='X75'>the Newsoms and Ewing Wair</COREF> , who was visiting <COREF ID='47' REF='34'>them</COREF> . <COREF ID='48' REF='19'>The crash</COREF> would never have happened had <COREF ID='49' REF='32'>the pilot</COREF> made a normal
take-off or taken <COREF ID='X121'>the cloudy weather</COREF> into account, <COREF ID='50' REF='31'>Smith</COREF> said after
an 11-week review of <COREF ID='51' REF='X121'>the incident</COREF> .
