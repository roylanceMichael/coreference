Washington, <COREF ID='6' REF='X7'>Feb. 22</COREF> ( <COREF ID='7' REF='X23'>Bloomberg</COREF> ) -- <COREF ID='X25'>The Navy</COREF> ordered <COREF ID='8' REF='X15'>its Northrop Grumman Corp. F-14s</COREF> out of the skies for <COREF ID='X28'>three days</COREF> while <COREF ID='11' REF='X25'>it</COREF>
investigates <COREF ID='12' REF='2'>three recent F-14 crashes</COREF> .
<COREF ID='X38'>The action</COREF> came after an F-14A fighter crashed <COREF ID='14' REF='X38'>today</COREF> in the
Persian Gulf. The two crew members ejected <COREF ID='X40'>and</COREF> were rescued and
returned to <COREF ID='X47'>the aircraft carrier</COREF> USS Nimitz with minor injuries,
the <COREF ID='15' REF='X25'>Navy</COREF> said.
Sunday, an F-14D crashed into the Pacific Ocean off southern
California, killing <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>its</COREF> two crew members. And on Jan. 29, an F-14A
crashed into houses in Nashville, Tennessee, after takeoff, killing
the two crew members and three people on the ground.
The cause of <COREF ID='17' REF='14'>today</COREF> 's crash is undetermined.
``In light of <COREF ID='18' REF='X40'>the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds</COREF> , the <COREF ID='19' REF='15'>Navy</COREF> has ordered <COREF ID='X82'>a 72-hour safety standdown</COREF> for <COREF ID='21' REF='X47'>all F-14 aircraft</COREF> ,'' said Lt. Greg Geisen, <COREF ID='22' REF='15'>a Navy spokesman</COREF> at the Pentagon.
``Although different models of <COREF ID='X88'>the F-14</COREF> have been involved in <COREF ID='25' REF='18'>these mishaps</COREF> , <COREF ID='X87'>it</COREF> is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight
operations for <COREF ID='26' REF='X88'>all F-14s</COREF> in order to assess the available
information and determine if procedural or other modifications to <COREF ID='27' REF='26'>F-14</COREF> operations are warranted,'' the <COREF ID='28' REF='19'>Navy</COREF> said.
A one-time exception to <COREF ID='29' REF='X82'>the standdown</COREF> will be allowed for <COREF ID='X102'>14</COREF>
F-14s on board the USS America, which is returning to <COREF ID='X107'>the United</COREF>
<COREF ID='X111'>States</COREF> from the <COREF ID='31' REF='X107'>Persian Gulf</COREF> and Bosnia, <COREF ID='32' REF='X107'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='33' REF='X111'>Those planes</COREF>
will be permitted to fly to Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia, as the ship nears port. <COREF ID='35' REF='X102'>The F14 ``Tomcat''</COREF> is <COREF ID='36' REF='21'>the Navy's first-line fighter aircraft</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='X87'>It</COREF>
has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or night. The <COREF ID='39' REF='28'>Navy</COREF> has <COREF ID='40' REF='27'>about 330 F-14s</COREF> in three models, As, Bs and Ds.
The models differ mainly in engines and avionics. <COREF ID='X142'>The A model</COREF>
uses engines from Pratt @amp; Whitney, <COREF ID='43' REF='X142'>a unit</COREF> of United Technologies
Corp. The B and D models use General Electric engines.
The <COREF ID='44' REF='39'>Navy</COREF> said there have been F-14 <COREF ID='X163'>32 crashes</COREF> since 1991. <COREF ID='46' REF='44'>That figure</COREF> isn't uncommon for <COREF ID='47' REF='39'>Navy</COREF> jet fighter aircraft, <COREF ID='48' REF='32'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='49' REF='36'>The aircraft</COREF> was introduced to the fleet in the mid 1970s, and
has undergone several upgrades since <COREF ID='50' REF='49'>then</COREF> , <COREF ID='51' REF='48'>Geisen</COREF> said. <COREF ID='52' REF='33'>The planes</COREF>
were made by Grumman Corp., <COREF ID='54' REF='X15'>now Northrop Grumman</COREF> , principally in
Calverton, New York, on Long Island. <COREF ID='55' REF='50'>The company</COREF> delivered the last
F-14 to the <COREF ID='56' REF='44'>Navy</COREF> in 1992, said <COREF ID='X187'>Northrop Grumman spokesman</COREF> John
Vosilla. <COREF ID='58' REF='X187'>He</COREF> referred all questions about <COREF ID='59' REF='17'>today</COREF> 's crash to the <COREF ID='60' REF='56'>Navy</COREF> .
Aviation safety and engineering experts will review <COREF ID='X195'>the data</COREF>
from <COREF ID='61' REF='X163'>the three recent crashes</COREF> and are to present <COREF ID='62' REF='X195'>their</COREF> findings to
the Chief of Naval Operations Mike Boorda in <COREF ID='63' REF='X28'>three days</COREF> , <COREF ID='64' REF='51'>Geisen</COREF>
said. <COREF ID='65' REF='54'>Northrop Grumman</COREF> shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at midday.
