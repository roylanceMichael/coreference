HALF MOON BAY, Calif. <COREF ID='6' REF='4'>Joe Reid</COREF> , who died <COREF ID='X24'>Thursday</COREF> when the
airplane <COREF ID='53' REF='X24'>he</COREF> was flying with <COREF ID='X30'>7-year-old Jessica Dubroff</COREF> and her
<COREF ID='X34'>father</COREF> crashed in Cheyenne, Wyo., took up flying the same way <COREF ID='10' REF='X34'>he</COREF>
did anything else: with <COREF ID='X39'>passion and attention</COREF> to detail.
``I respected <COREF ID='11' REF='X39'>his</COREF> leadership, <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>his</COREF> thoroughness,'' said <COREF ID='X41'>Gary</COREF>
Petersen, <COREF ID='13' REF='X41'>manager</COREF> of Half Moon Bay Airport. `` <COREF ID='15' REF='13'>He</COREF> was always capable
and competent, <COREF ID='16' REF='15'>a real by-the-book guy</COREF> @amp;MD; very thorough, very
detailed.'' <COREF ID='17' REF='6'>Reid</COREF> , 52, who for nearly 27 years was <COREF ID='18' REF='17'>a broker at the Dean Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto</COREF> , was <COREF ID='19' REF='X13'>president of the Half Moon Bay Pilots Association</COREF> .
George Auld, <COREF ID='20' REF='19'>a longtime friend</COREF> who co-owned <COREF ID='X74'>the aircraft</COREF> that
crashed, said <COREF ID='22' REF='X74'>he</COREF> had first taken <COREF ID='23' REF='17'>Reid</COREF> up in <COREF ID='X85'>a small plane</COREF> in 1970. <COREF ID='24' REF='22'>He</COREF> said <COREF ID='25' REF='17'>Reid</COREF> , <COREF ID='26' REF='25'>a Vietnam veteran</COREF> , got <COREF ID='27' REF='12'>his</COREF> pilot's license in the
late 1970s and was certified to be <COREF ID='28' REF='3'>an instructor</COREF> about four years
ago.
<COREF ID='X96'>They</COREF> bought <COREF ID='29' REF='X85'>the plane</COREF> , <COREF ID='30' REF='29'>a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B Cardinal</COREF> , about nine years ago.
`` <COREF ID='31' REF='30'>He</COREF> loved <COREF ID='32' REF='31'>flying</COREF> and helping other people learn the excitement
of <COREF ID='33' REF='32'>flying</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='34' REF='33'>Auld</COREF> said. `` <COREF ID='35' REF='6'>Joe</COREF> 's not the type to do <COREF ID='X107'>anything half</COREF>
way.'' <COREF ID='36' REF='23'>Reid</COREF> began giving lessons to <COREF ID='37' REF='X30'>Jessica</COREF> about five months ago and
was supportive of <COREF ID='38' REF='37'>her</COREF> effort to become <COREF ID='X118'>the youngest person</COREF> ever to
make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.
`` <COREF ID='39' REF='X118'>I</COREF> 'm teaching <COREF ID='40' REF='39'>her</COREF> just like <COREF ID='41' REF='40'>I</COREF> would anybody else,'' <COREF ID='42' REF='41'>he</COREF> said.
``Mentally, <COREF ID='43' REF='42'>she</COREF> grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''
Forrest Storz, who also gives <COREF ID='44' REF='33'>flying</COREF> lessons at the airport,
called <COREF ID='46' REF='36'>Reid</COREF> <COREF ID='47' REF='46'>``an exceptional, competent pilot.''</COREF> <COREF ID='48' REF='36'>Reid</COREF> , who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from
Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in
<COREF ID='X152'>the <COREF ID='49' REF='X107'>Half Moon Bay</COREF> community and serving</COREF> a fourth term on the
Coastside County Water District board. <COREF ID='50' REF='X152'>He</COREF> also was <COREF ID='51' REF='X39'>a member of the San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee</COREF> and was <COREF ID='52' REF='49'>chairman of the annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show</COREF> .
He and his wife, Ana, were <COREF ID='57' REF='X96'>active parishioners</COREF> at Our Lady of
the Pillar Catholic Church. <COREF ID='58' REF='X96'>They</COREF> had two sons, Christopher, 27, of
Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half Moon Bay.
