c.1996 <COREF ID='X30'>N.Y. Times News Service</COREF> <COREF ID='5' REF='2'>A Valujet DC-9 jetliner</COREF> with <COREF ID='7' REF='X13'>109 people</COREF> aboard crashed in the <COREF ID='8' REF='X14'>Florida Everglades</COREF> shortly after takeoff from Miami International
<COREF ID='X34'>Airport</COREF> on Saturday afternoon. Aviation and rescue officials found
widely scattered <COREF ID='X40'>debris</COREF> and said <COREF ID='X39'>there</COREF> were apparently no
survivors.
Bound for Atlanta, <COREF ID='9' REF='X39'>the twin-engine aircraft</COREF> was <COREF ID='X43'>about 30 miles</COREF>
northwest of <COREF ID='70' REF='X34'>Miami airport</COREF> when <COREF ID='X47'>the pilot</COREF> reported smoke in the
cockpit, <COREF ID='X51'>a spokesman</COREF> for the Federal Aviation Administration said. <COREF ID='12' REF='X47'>The plane</COREF> was believed to be turning back to <COREF ID='13' REF='70'>the airport</COREF> when radar
contact was lost shortly after 2 p.m.
``We believe that <COREF ID='15' REF='9'>the aircraft</COREF> is down somewhere in the vicinity
of the <COREF ID='16' REF='8'>Florida Everglades</COREF> ,'' <COREF ID='X66'>the <COREF ID='17' REF='X51'>FAA spokesman</COREF> , <COREF ID='19' REF='X66'>Anthony Willett</COREF> ,</COREF>
said.
<COREF ID='X68'>The cause</COREF> of <COREF ID='20' REF='2'>the crash</COREF> was unclear. Valujet Airlines Inc., which
is based in <COREF ID='22' REF='X68'>Atlanta</COREF> and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began
operations in 1993 with <COREF ID='X81'>an old fleet</COREF> that has grown to about 50
planes. <COREF ID='23' REF='X81'>It</COREF> has experienced a number of problems, including several
aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but
never a crash.
Television pictures from helicopters flying over the <COREF ID='24' REF='16'>Everglades</COREF>
at midafternoon showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or
other large sections of <COREF ID='25' REF='12'>the plane</COREF> , only what appeared to be <COREF ID='26' REF='X40'>widely scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses and desolate swamps</COREF> . It was unclear how deep the water was.
The <COREF ID='27' REF='17'>FAA</COREF> said the crash site was <COREF ID='29' REF='X43'>15 miles west of Opa Locka</COREF> , or <COREF ID='30' REF='X43'>about 20 miles northwest of Miami</COREF> . But it was unclear by late
Saturday afternoon whether <COREF ID='X124'>the precise <COREF ID='32' REF='20'>crash</COREF> site</COREF> had been located.
One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be
scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of <COREF ID='X128'>wreckage</COREF>
or survivors from Valujet's Flight 592, <COREF ID='35' REF='X128'>a daily two-hour flight</COREF>
from Miami to <COREF ID='71' REF='22'>Atlanta</COREF> . <COREF ID='38' REF='X124'>The crash site</COREF> appeared to be inaccessible by road. The Coast
Guard dispatched rescue helicopters <COREF ID='X146'>and</COREF> aircraft to <COREF ID='40' REF='38'>the site</COREF> , and
airboats were being mustered to carry <COREF ID='X152'>rescue and other emergency</COREF>
personnel to <COREF ID='41' REF='X152'>the area</COREF> . <COREF ID='42' REF='2'>Valujet</COREF> said in a statement that <COREF ID='43' REF='25'>the plane</COREF> was carrying <COREF ID='44' REF='X146'>104 passengers and a crew of five</COREF> . Earlier reports had said that as
many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.
Valujet's fleet, said to be <COREF ID='46' REF='X30'>the oldest in the industry</COREF> , has run
into a series of problems in the last two and a half years, the
most serious being <COREF ID='X181'>a fire</COREF> on June 8 last year that destroyed a DC-9
on a runway in <COREF ID='47' REF='71'>Atlanta</COREF> .
A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were
reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.
An FAA investigation in the wake of <COREF ID='49' REF='X181'>the fire</COREF> found ``a
significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by <COREF ID='50' REF='42'>Valujet</COREF> as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers.'' <COREF ID='51' REF='X68'>The inquiry</COREF> said <COREF ID='52' REF='50'>Valujet</COREF> 's rapid expansion from two to 48 planes
had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving
inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently
trained flight attendants.
