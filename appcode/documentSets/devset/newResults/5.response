<COREF ID='X5'>Minnesota</COREF> Isn't 'Bashing' <COREF ID='X6'>Mediation</COREF>

I was pleased to see your May 5 article, "Farm-Debt Mediation Catches On in Iowa."
<COREF ID='5' REF='X6'>Farm-debt mediation</COREF> is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of <COREF ID='X28'>the most devastating crash</COREF> in the farm economy since the Great Depression.
<COREF ID='10' REF='X28'>I</COREF> am compelled, however, to comment on <COREF ID='11' REF='10'>your</COREF> evaluation of Minnesota's mediation program.
While <COREF ID='14' REF='X5'>Minnesota's program</COREF> has met <COREF ID='X41'>some resistance</COREF> from creditors, <COREF ID='16' REF='X41'>it</COREF> nonetheless has been a solid success.
As of April 24, there were <COREF ID='X47'>3,864 mediations</COREF> that either have been completed or were in progress.
Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement.
<COREF ID='X56'>It</COREF> is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, <COREF ID='17' REF='X47'>Minnesota mediation</COREF> works.
<COREF ID='19' REF='X56'>It</COREF> helps keep <COREF ID='X61'>farmers</COREF> on the land and <COREF ID='20' REF='X61'>creditors</COREF> in business.
Most important, as the University of <COREF ID='X68'>Minnesota</COREF> found when <COREF ID='21' REF='19'>it</COREF> evaluated <COREF ID='22' REF='14'>the program</COREF> last winter, <COREF ID='23' REF='17'>mediation</COREF> has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas.
Moreover, recent data indicate that <COREF ID='24' REF='23'>mediation</COREF> is a viable alternative to bankruptcy.
An analysis completed by the Center for Rural Affairs indicates that states with <COREF ID='25' REF='24'>mediation</COREF> have had proportionately fewer Chapter <COREF ID='X88'>12 bankruptcy</COREF> filings.
Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, <COREF ID='26' REF='X68'>Minnesota</COREF> had the fewest <COREF ID='27' REF='X88'>Chapter 12</COREF> filings per 1,000 farmers.
As <COREF ID='28' REF='27'>your article</COREF> notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering <COREF ID='X102'>various amendments</COREF> to the Mediation Act.
However, <COREF ID='30' REF='X102'>the proposed amendments</COREF> are not the result of " <COREF ID='31' REF='25'>mediation</COREF> -bashing," as <COREF ID='32' REF='28'>the article</COREF> suggests.
Rather, <COREF ID='33' REF='30'>they</COREF> are <COREF ID='X114'>the result</COREF> of a growing consensus that <COREF ID='34' REF='31'>mediation</COREF> works and should be improved in order to ensure <COREF ID='35' REF='21'>it</COREF> works even better.
The program's record speaks for <COREF ID='37' REF='X114'>itself</COREF> .
<COREF ID='38' REF='35'>It</COREF> demonstrates that <COREF ID='39' REF='X61'>farmers</COREF> and lenders can work together to solve <COREF ID='X122'>the challenge</COREF> created by <COREF ID='40' REF='33'>the continuing crisis</COREF> in our nation's rural economy. <COREF ID='42' REF='X122'>Hubert H. Humphrey III</COREF>
