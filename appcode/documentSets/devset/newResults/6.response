<COREF ID='1' REF='X12'>National Broadcasting Co.</COREF> told <COREF ID='X18'>its technicians and news employees union</COREF> that <COREF ID='3' REF='1'>the network</COREF> will put into effect next Monday <COREF ID='4' REF='X3'>its latest contract offer</COREF> .
<COREF ID='6' REF='X18'>Union</COREF> leaders said <COREF ID='X19'>the move</COREF> probably means the union's 2,800 NBC members -- <COREF ID='9' REF='X19'>about a third of the company's work force</COREF> -- will strike.
"It looks like <COREF ID='11' REF='X19'>we</COREF> 're going to be <COREF ID='X32'>there</COREF> on the street, unless there is a miracle," said John Krieger, <COREF ID='12' REF='X32'>a spokesman</COREF> for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which last struck NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, in 1976.
The possibility of <COREF ID='15' REF='X5'>a strike</COREF> comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling.
On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought <COREF ID='16' REF='X2'>NBC</COREF> and <COREF ID='17' REF='6'>the union</COREF> together for the first time since <COREF ID='18' REF='6'>the union</COREF> 's four-year contract expired March 31.
Both sides were deadlocked.
Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at <COREF ID='19' REF='16'>NBC</COREF> , the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services.</TXT>
