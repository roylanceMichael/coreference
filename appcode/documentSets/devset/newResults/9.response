<COREF ID='X33'>Treasury Secretary James Baker</COREF> held a 7 1/2-hour negotiating session with top Canadian officials, and <COREF ID='X27'>the two sides</COREF> made progress toward possible resumption of <COREF ID='1' REF='X5'>talks on a free-trade pact</COREF> .
" <COREF ID='2' REF='X27'>We</COREF> have been reviewing all elements of the trade agreement, and <COREF ID='3' REF='2'>we</COREF> made <COREF ID='X38'>a lot</COREF> of progress <COREF ID='4' REF='X38'>today</COREF> ," <COREF ID='X45'>Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney</COREF> told reporters.
But <COREF ID='5' REF='X45'>she</COREF> said a decision by <COREF ID='X49'>Canada</COREF> on whether to resume <COREF ID='6' REF='3'>the negotiations</COREF> wouldn't come until after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and <COREF ID='7' REF='3'>his</COREF> cabinet have been briefed <COREF ID='8' REF='4'>today</COREF> .
<COREF ID='9' REF='X33'>Mr. Baker</COREF> and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement that <COREF ID='10' REF='9'>the daylong meeting</COREF> was "a thorough discussion of all the elements involved in <COREF ID='11' REF='6'>the negotiations</COREF> ."
They added, "We are hopeful that this will provide a basis for <COREF ID='12' REF='11'>the negotiations</COREF> to resume, and <COREF ID='X67'>the U.S.</COREF> remains prepared to resume <COREF ID='13' REF='11'>negotiations</COREF> at any time."
<COREF ID='14' REF='X49'>Canada</COREF> walked out of the <COREF ID='15' REF='X5'>talks</COREF> last week, claiming that the <COREF ID='16' REF='X67'>U.S.</COREF> had shown <COREF ID='X81'>insufficient flexibility</COREF> on <COREF ID='17' REF='X81'>Ottawa</COREF> 's main demand for a binding mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries.</TXT>
