Amr corp.'s <COREF ID='5' REF='X17'>American Airlines unit</COREF> said <COREF ID='6' REF='5'>it</COREF> has called for <COREF ID='7' REF='X4'>federal mediation</COREF> in <COREF ID='X24'>its contract talks</COREF> with unions representing its pilots and flight attendants.
<COREF ID='X32'>A spokesman</COREF> for <COREF ID='14' REF='7'>the company</COREF> said <COREF ID='15' REF='X2'>American</COREF> officials "felt <COREF ID='X29'>talks</COREF> had reached a point where <COREF ID='17' REF='7'>mediation</COREF> would be helpful."
<COREF ID='X40'>Negotiations</COREF> with <COREF ID='18' REF='X29'>the pilots</COREF> have been going on for 11 months; <COREF ID='X36'>talks</COREF> with <COREF ID='19' REF='X36'>flight attendants</COREF> began six months ago.
The president of <COREF ID='X50'>the Association</COREF> of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American's more than 10,000 flight attendants, called the request for <COREF ID='X46'>mediation</COREF> "premature" and characterized <COREF ID='24' REF='6'>it</COREF> as a bargaining tactic that could lead to a lockout.
<COREF ID='25' REF='X40'>Patt gibbs</COREF> , <COREF ID='26' REF='X50'>president of the association</COREF> , said talks with <COREF ID='X64'>the company</COREF> seemed to be progressing well and <COREF ID='29' REF='X46'>the call for mediation</COREF> came as a surprise.
The major outstanding issue in <COREF ID='X74'>the negotiations</COREF> with the flight attendants is <COREF ID='33' REF='X64'>a two-tier wage scale</COREF> , in which recent employees' salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at <COREF ID='34' REF='15'>american</COREF> for a longer time.
<COREF ID='X88'>The union</COREF> wants to narrow the differences between <COREF ID='X90'>the new scale</COREF> and the old one.
<COREF ID='36' REF='X64'>The company</COREF> declined to comment on <COREF ID='37' REF='X74'>the negotiations</COREF> or the outstanding issues.
Representatives for the 5,400-member Allied Pilots Association didn't return phone calls.
Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, if the mediator fails to bring the two sides together and <COREF ID='38' REF='33'>the two sides</COREF> don't agree to binding arbitration, <COREF ID='X106'>a 30-day cooling-off period</COREF> follows.
After <COREF ID='39' REF='X106'>that</COREF> , the union can strike or <COREF ID='40' REF='36'>the company</COREF> can lock <COREF ID='41' REF='X88'>the union</COREF> out.
<COREF ID='42' REF='25'>Ms. Gibbs</COREF> said that in response to <COREF ID='43' REF='40'>the company</COREF> 's move, <COREF ID='44' REF='41'>her union</COREF> will be "escalating" <COREF ID='46' REF='X24'>its</COREF> "corporate campaign" against <COREF ID='47' REF='34'>American</COREF> over the next couple of months.
In a corporate campaign, a union tries to get a company's financiers, investors, directors and other financial partners to pressure <COREF ID='48' REF='43'>the company</COREF> to meet <COREF ID='49' REF='44'>union</COREF> demands.
<COREF ID='50' REF='X32'>A corporate campaign</COREF> , <COREF ID='51' REF='50'>she</COREF> said, appeals to <COREF ID='52' REF='44'>her members</COREF> because " <COREF ID='54' REF='24'>it</COREF> is a nice, clean way to take a job action, and <COREF ID='55' REF='54'>our women</COREF> are hired to be nice." <COREF ID='56' REF='49'>the union</COREF> has decided not to strike, <COREF ID='57' REF='56'>she</COREF> said.
<COREF ID='58' REF='56'>The union</COREF> has hired a number of professional consultants in <COREF ID='59' REF='46'>its</COREF> battle with <COREF ID='60' REF='48'>the company</COREF> , including <COREF ID='X147'>Ray Rogers</COREF> of Corporate Campaign Inc., <COREF ID='61' REF='X90'>the New York labor consultant</COREF> who developed the strategy at Geo. A. Hormel @amp; Co.'s Austin, Minn., meatpacking plant last year.
That campaign, which included a strike, faltered when <COREF ID='63' REF='60'>the company</COREF> hired new workers and the International Meatpacking Union wrested control of the local union from <COREF ID='64' REF='X147'>Rogers</COREF> ' supporters.</TXT>
